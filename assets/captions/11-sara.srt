
4686
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,612
Light mode versus dark mode, I
have changed the title to

4687
00:00:02,612 --> 00:00:06,719
Why Not Both? Or why building
both dark and light schemes

4688
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:11,633
together is easy, actually.
I hope I'm not overselling

4689
00:00:11,633 --> 00:00:16,334
that. Hi, I'm Sara. I have am
both an old hand,

4690
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,640
like Mike said, I've been
building websites as a teenager

4691
00:00:23,247 --> 00:00:25,247
since 1999, only my own stuff.
It was only ever really a hobby

4692
00:00:25,247 --> 00:00:27,247
thing.

4693
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:31,053
I had a long hiatus. And now
I'm a newbie, again, I

4694
00:00:34,058 --> 00:00:36,058
switched my career from doing
general electronic and other

4695
00:00:36,058 --> 00:00:38,058
stuff in small companies and a
couple of big companies.

4696
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:42,474
And I jumped into web
development,

4697
00:00:42,474 --> 00:00:44,474
not last year, two years ago
now. I still feel like a

4698
00:00:44,474 --> 00:00:46,474
newbie. I guess I'm not, but I
feel like one.

4699
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:51,610
Just a little warning that
there's already been some

4700
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:53,610
movement, there'll be some more
movement, a tiny bit of

4701
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,610
animation and abrupt changes
between dark and light modes in

4702
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,610
this presentation. Because it's
difficult not to.

4703
00:00:57,635 --> 00:01:01,046
If you suffer from migraines,
epilepsy, strong

4704
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:06,350
astigmiatism,

4705
00:01:07,758 --> 00:01:09,758
I'm really sorry, but I hope
with this information I'm about

4706
00:01:09,758 --> 00:01:11,758
to present to you, browsing the
web will get more comfortable

4707
00:01:11,758 --> 00:01:14,674
for you and everyone else.
So with that aside, I'll try

4708
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:16,674
and warn whenever I'm about to
flash the screen from dark to

4709
00:01:16,674 --> 00:01:20,598
light. Let's get started. Dark
mode versus light mode.

4710
00:01:23,202 --> 00:01:26,504
And we all love a good
polarizing argument. And what

4711
00:01:26,504 --> 00:01:29,616
could be more polarizing in
dark versus light? But there

4712
00:01:29,616 --> 00:01:31,616
are physical reasons to prefer
one over the other.

4713
00:01:33,421 --> 00:01:35,421
And just allowed to prefer dark
or light mode. That's OK.

4714
00:01:37,529 --> 00:01:39,529
You don't have to have a
logical reason for it because

4715
00:01:39,529 --> 00:01:41,529
your eye is your choice.

4716
00:01:42,342 --> 00:01:46,844
So that said, why dark mode?
Your pupils constrict when they

4717
00:01:46,844 --> 00:01:49,873
come across a bright page or
bright anything. I think you

4718
00:01:49,873 --> 00:01:51,873
can quite often notice.

4719
00:01:53,176 --> 00:01:55,279
You feel the muscles pulling
your pupil, pulling your iris

4720
00:01:55,279 --> 00:01:57,279
inwards to make your pupils
smaller.

4721
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:01,678
And if you're in a dark
surroundings, like I am right

4722
00:02:01,678 --> 00:02:06,789
now, yeah, it's quarter past
10:00 here. If you suddenly

4723
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:08,789
jump into a bright website,
that's uncomfortable.

4724
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:14,007
And then, other people have
floaters that appear or block

4725
00:02:14,007 --> 00:02:16,007
their vision.

4726
00:02:17,308 --> 00:02:20,515
A lot of you may, I mean, I'm
40 now, so sometimes, when I'm

4727
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,515
looking up at a bright sky, I
see these things.

4728
00:02:25,117 --> 00:02:27,117
The second example on the right
is a bit more

4729
00:02:28,324 --> 00:02:30,324
what I see, sort of translucent
something or other drifting

4730
00:02:30,324 --> 00:02:32,324
across.

4731
00:02:33,132 --> 00:02:36,236
That some people with really
severe floaters might struggle

4732
00:02:36,236 --> 00:02:38,236
to read, text on a light
background

4733
00:02:39,337 --> 00:02:41,337
because the light background
just sort of is distorted

4734
00:02:41,337 --> 00:02:43,337
through the floaters.

4735
00:02:43,659 --> 00:02:45,659
Why light mode?

4736
00:02:47,558 --> 00:02:50,659
Pupils constrict when coming
across a bright page . But that

4737
00:02:50,659 --> 00:02:52,659
can be a good thing, actually,
because it's easier to

4738
00:02:52,659 --> 00:02:54,659
focus when your pupil is
smaller.

4739
00:02:57,377 --> 00:03:00,479
Like with a camera (inaudible)
you might close your aperture

4740
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:02,479
in order to get a whole
landscape in focus.

4741
00:03:04,894 --> 00:03:06,894
Whereas if the aperture is
large, you have to very

4742
00:03:06,894 --> 00:03:10,705
carefully focus on separate
items. You have your foreground

4743
00:03:10,705 --> 00:03:12,705
and background and they're
different and you have to

4744
00:03:14,314 --> 00:03:16,314
focus and it's the same with
your eyes, they have to work to

4745
00:03:17,522 --> 00:03:19,522
focus more when your pupil is
large because everything's

4746
00:03:19,522 --> 00:03:21,522
darker.

4747
00:03:24,234 --> 00:03:26,234
And then, people have
astigmiatism

4748
00:03:29,241 --> 00:03:31,241
STIG

4749
00:03:32,652 --> 00:03:34,953
stigmatism. Light text on dark
backgrounds can become hard to

4750
00:03:34,953 --> 00:03:36,953
read.

4751
00:03:38,258 --> 00:03:40,258
They might be clear like they
are now, but with a little bit

4752
00:03:40,258 --> 00:03:42,258
of extra fuzz and your brain
and eyes work together to

4753
00:03:44,072 --> 00:03:46,072
try to sharpen out that fuzz to
try to focus better.

4754
00:03:47,677 --> 00:03:49,677
But when you can't, get away
from that.

4755
00:03:52,086 --> 00:03:54,293
When you can't get...  when you
start to get headaches.

4756
00:04:00,501 --> 00:04:02,501
Interestingly, I found a lot
more examples about this and

4757
00:04:02,501 --> 00:04:04,501
people struggling with dark
mode, because clearly there's a

4758
00:04:04,501 --> 00:04:06,501
lot of people annoyed about
websites only available in dark

4759
00:04:06,501 --> 00:04:10,210
mode.
So there's really loads of

4760
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:12,210
examples people have made

4761
00:04:14,825 --> 00:04:16,825
of slightly fuzzed out or
distorted text, light text on a

4762
00:04:16,825 --> 00:04:19,427
dark background. And even, I'm
looking at these, and you know,

4763
00:04:19,427 --> 00:04:21,427
I'm trying to focus them.

4764
00:04:23,022 --> 00:04:25,631
I can feel my eyes and my brain
trying to focus these bits of

4765
00:04:25,631 --> 00:04:27,631
text and I can't, of course.

4766
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:31,039
And if you're staring at this
all the time, it's going to

4767
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:33,039
hurt.

4768
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:35,647
And I love this one, I am the
douche

4769
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:40,650
bag that makes people read
white text on a black

4770
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,650
background.

4771
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,650
So that would be why you might
prefer light mode.

4772
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:46,650
Why not both?

4773
00:04:48,203 --> 00:04:50,203
Both. Both. Both is good.

4774
00:04:54,725 --> 00:04:56,725
I'm sure everyone gets that
reference.

4775
00:04:56,725 --> 00:04:59,531
[ Laughter ]
Anyway. So in this talk scope,

4776
00:04:59,531 --> 00:05:01,531
is just having

4777
00:05:02,627 --> 00:05:05,937
your site react to preferred
color scheme.

4778
00:05:08,544 --> 00:05:10,544
So I'm not going to talk about
manual toggling. It can be

4779
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:12,544
done. I will show you it.

4780
00:05:17,055 --> 00:05:20,157
Shortly because with a bit hof
of JavaScript, it's easy and

4781
00:05:20,157 --> 00:05:22,157
you can find advice on the
internet including

4782
00:05:22,464 --> 00:05:26,191
me trying to give advice on it.
I've got a little toggle here.

4783
00:05:26,191 --> 00:05:28,191
Be warned, it's going to go
white.

4784
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:31,296
And back, again.

4785
00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:35,409
I'm back to auto. So the
toggling is absolutely

4786
00:05:35,409 --> 00:05:37,409
possible.

4787
00:05:37,821 --> 00:05:41,624
But I'm not going to go into
how to do that in this talk.

4788
00:05:43,431 --> 00:05:45,735
And I must remember to click
right. So this is what I get

4789
00:05:45,735 --> 00:05:47,735
for rolling my own
presentation.

4790
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,840
So starting from scratch. If
you have no styles, this is no

4791
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,840
problem.

4792
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:55,645
However, if you have already
really big

4793
00:05:56,853 --> 00:06:00,068
mature site or design system or
massive project , this may be

4794
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:02,068
tricky to bring into your
projects.

4795
00:06:03,369 --> 00:06:06,772
If everything already has
specific colors , branding,

4796
00:06:06,772 --> 00:06:10,079
everything's set, it's going to
be hard to put this back in.

4797
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:12,079
It's possible. I'm sure it's
possible.

4798
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:14,090
But it's going to be difficult.

4799
00:06:16,908 --> 00:06:20,008
But I want you to keep this
light mode/ dark mode bothness

4800
00:06:20,008 --> 00:06:22,008
in mind next time you have --
you start a new project.

4801
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,420
So we know this, we all have

4802
00:06:28,624 --> 00:06:31,726
seen default HTML themes, not
that we look at it anymore

4803
00:06:31,726 --> 00:06:33,726
because you probably set your
CSS reset before you even look

4804
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,726
at the page.

4805
00:06:38,223 --> 00:06:40,223
I often set everything to just
san serif at least before I

4806
00:06:40,223 --> 00:06:42,223
start anything.

4807
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,840
It's standard HTML here.
There's nothing unusual.

4808
00:06:48,655 --> 00:06:50,655
But you may not know that
there's also default dark

4809
00:06:50,655 --> 00:06:52,655
theme.

4810
00:06:56,664 --> 00:06:58,664
And everything's done for you,
the buttons, the inputs, the

4811
00:06:58,664 --> 00:07:00,664
link.

4812
00:07:03,283 --> 00:07:05,283
Link colors here have all been
adjusted already to look better

4813
00:07:05,283 --> 00:07:07,283
in dark mode. You don't have to
do it.

4814
00:07:07,283 --> 00:07:11,713
The browser's done it for you.
How do we get to that? You

4815
00:07:11,713 --> 00:07:13,713
don't even need CSS.

4816
00:07:18,826 --> 00:07:20,826
And Mayank did hint to this
earlier that you can put a

4817
00:07:20,826 --> 00:07:22,826
metatag in your HTML.

4818
00:07:23,336 --> 00:07:26,435
The meta  name is color-scheme.
And the content is light/dark.

4819
00:07:28,465 --> 00:07:30,465
You can put dark/light.

4820
00:07:32,653 --> 00:07:35,749
It might make a difference if a
user's OS isn't broadcasting

4821
00:07:35,749 --> 00:07:37,749
I'm in

4822
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,749
light mode or I'm in dark mode.
I'm not sure many of them do

4823
00:07:39,749 --> 00:07:41,749
that now.

4824
00:07:42,857 --> 00:07:45,068
I think almost all of them are
in light mode or dark mode,

4825
00:07:45,068 --> 00:07:47,068
there might be some that don't
care.

4826
00:07:48,369 --> 00:07:50,577
If there's some that don't
care, if you put dark/light, it

4827
00:07:50,577 --> 00:07:52,577
may be that your website shows
in dark mode first.

4828
00:07:52,987 --> 00:07:55,794
As a preference. I haven't been
able to test it.

4829
00:07:59,398 --> 00:08:01,398
You can also put it in your
CSS.

4830
00:08:02,696 --> 00:08:06,200
So, under the root or HTML
selector, you have color

4831
00:08:09,306 --> 00:08:11,306
-scheme, color light/dark.

4832
00:08:12,414 --> 00:08:16,819
This website can show up in
light or dark, no problem.

4833
00:08:16,819 --> 00:08:20,226
And then, the browser will
follow the operating system's

4834
00:08:20,226 --> 00:08:22,226
preference and show you your
preferred version of this

4835
00:08:22,226 --> 00:08:24,226
website.

4836
00:08:28,527 --> 00:08:30,527
So just as an example, in
CodePen, tech

4837
00:08:32,331 --> 00:08:34,331
nically, it has a separate
place for the he, head.

4838
00:08:37,036 --> 00:08:39,036
You're not supposed to put the
head here within the HTML, but

4839
00:08:39,036 --> 00:08:41,036
you can do it and it seems to
work. This is what I'm using as

4840
00:08:41,036 --> 00:08:43,036
a display.

4841
00:08:43,654 --> 00:08:45,654
And because my laptop, my
Windows is

4842
00:08:47,462 --> 00:08:50,073
in dark mode because I prefer
the dark mode, it's going to

4843
00:08:50,073 --> 00:08:52,073
dark.

4844
00:08:54,273 --> 00:08:56,273
I could just -- drop dark, go
back to light.

4845
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,990
In fact, I can put some sort of
gibberish

4846
00:09:04,192 --> 00:09:06,192
in there and it'll still be
light because light remains the

4847
00:09:06,192 --> 00:09:08,192
default default.

4848
00:09:11,402 --> 00:09:13,402
Or I can say all of this is
going to be dark.

4849
00:09:16,913 --> 00:09:18,913
And just to prove this is the
case, I'll pop open dev tools

4850
00:09:18,913 --> 00:09:20,913
here.

4851
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:29,832
We've got color scheme
light/dark, prefers from dev

4852
00:09:29,832 --> 00:09:31,832
tools. Oh, everything is light.

4853
00:09:35,235 --> 00:09:37,235
I'll put it back to automatic,
which is what my laptop wants

4854
00:09:37,235 --> 00:09:39,853
to be. For some reason, this
gets home in a very

4855
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,160
strange position, I suspect
it's this head getting annoyed

4856
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,160
with real head, I'm not sure
entirely what's going on there.

4857
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,683
We also have system colors and
the most reliable of these is

4858
00:09:50,683 --> 00:09:52,683
canvas text.

4859
00:09:52,683 --> 00:09:55,787
And canvas. And they're kind of
what you expect them to be.

4860
00:09:57,984 --> 00:09:59,984
Don't confuse them with canvas,
the element canvas.

4861
00:10:02,091 --> 00:10:04,091
Con vas text is the color of
the text. Canvas is the color

4862
00:10:04,091 --> 00:10:06,091
of your background.

4863
00:10:08,499 --> 00:10:10,499
Here, you can see I've just
done

4864
00:10:13,308 --> 00:10:15,308
a div with what you've expected
and I've reversed them. And

4865
00:10:15,308 --> 00:10:17,308
just reversed in here.

4866
00:10:18,514 --> 00:10:20,514
If I call this dark, it's dark.
I'll put it back to light.

4867
00:10:25,613 --> 00:10:27,613
Or I can do light/dark and
it'll turn dark, again,

4868
00:10:27,613 --> 00:10:31,409
because my laptop is in dark
mode. So you can apply color

4869
00:10:31,409 --> 00:10:34,815
scheme to elements, but you do
need to put the canvas text and

4870
00:10:34,815 --> 00:10:36,815
the canvas in there first.

4871
00:10:40,087 --> 00:10:42,087
If I just remove them

4872
00:10:43,183 --> 00:10:46,586
here, it doesn't quite work
because your element is sort of

4873
00:10:46,586 --> 00:10:48,893
transparent by default.

4874
00:10:58,193 --> 00:11:01,291
You need to have given them a
color before you can put a

4875
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:03,291
color on an element otherwise
it's got nothing to work on.

4876
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:05,291
I found that by trial and
error.

4877
00:11:07,983 --> 00:11:11,588
There are other system colors
and I have a role, because

4878
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:15,579
they're patchy and I wanted to
tell you it's patchy and it's a

4879
00:11:15,579 --> 00:11:17,579
bit sad.

4880
00:11:18,874 --> 00:11:20,874
I can get rid of dev tools now,
too, apologies.

4881
00:11:23,074 --> 00:11:26,172
Here, you'd expect that link
text, which is being applied to

4882
00:11:26,172 --> 00:11:28,172
this one should look like the
text of the actual link.

4883
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:33,079
And visited text should look
like the color of the text of

4884
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:35,079
an actual visited thing. And
active text should look like,

4885
00:11:35,079 --> 00:11:37,079
let's have a dash go to this
link.

4886
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:40,094
It should look like that.
Unfortunately, it does not.

4887
00:11:44,098 --> 00:11:46,098
This is Edge I'm using, so
Chrome yum

4888
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:51,698
Chromium. Who does do it well
is Firefox

4889
00:11:54,299 --> 00:11:56,299
. Beautiful, link text looks
like link text.

4890
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:00,599
(Audio cutting out) visited
text.

4891
00:12:05,594 --> 00:12:07,594
So,

4892
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:10,296
Firefox for that one. I believe
they're going to trickle

4893
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:12,296
through, but I have not seen
any improvement in a couple of

4894
00:12:12,296 --> 00:12:15,091
years. Maybe we can push on
that. Contrast too high.

4895
00:12:18,887 --> 00:12:20,887
So you're there, you've got
your con

4896
00:12:23,095 --> 00:12:25,095
canvas and your canvas text and
you're thinking like, great,

4897
00:12:25,095 --> 00:12:27,095
but I don't just want to use
those.

4898
00:12:27,404 --> 00:12:31,309
Maybe contrast is a bit too
high. And like is written

4899
00:12:31,309 --> 00:12:33,309
there, those implementing

4900
00:12:35,315 --> 00:12:37,315
WCAG for accessibility may find
it unlikely that contrast could

4901
00:12:37,315 --> 00:12:39,712
be too high. But for some, for
example, migrainers, they do

4902
00:12:39,712 --> 00:12:41,712
have trouble with this.

4903
00:12:43,605 --> 00:12:46,701
It can kick off micro
migraines, especially on

4904
00:12:46,701 --> 00:12:49,797
websites where things are
moving and scrolling if the

4905
00:12:49,797 --> 00:12:51,797
contrast is too high, it can
start to kick things off.

4906
00:12:52,197 --> 00:12:54,197
But there's also preferred
contrast.

4907
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,193
This is a bit tricky because
I'm not sure where you can set

4908
00:12:59,193 --> 00:13:01,193
preferred contrast in your
operating systems. But it's

4909
00:13:01,193 --> 00:13:03,193
there.

4910
00:13:03,193 --> 00:13:06,091
And I'm fairly sure prefers
color scheme came before all

4911
00:13:06,091 --> 00:13:08,091
OSs allowed you to

4912
00:13:08,303 --> 00:13:10,303
toggle dark or light.

4913
00:13:11,894 --> 00:13:15,099
So, hoping that prefers
contrast starts allowing OSs to

4914
00:13:15,099 --> 00:13:17,099
allow you to toggle contrast.

4915
00:13:20,206 --> 00:13:22,206
The simplest way to bring
contrast down across the board

4916
00:13:22,206 --> 00:13:24,206
is filter contrast.

4917
00:13:28,213 --> 00:13:31,309
So, for example, that's just an
extra thing I've added there .

4918
00:13:31,309 --> 00:13:33,309
I've added a filter,

4919
00:13:33,309 --> 00:13:35,615
prefers less. And filtering the
whole thing by half, which is

4920
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,615
possibly a bit extreme.

4921
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:40,117
But let's bring dev tools back
in.

4922
00:13:43,103 --> 00:13:46,310
And under rendering, under here
so with the -- I'm trying to

4923
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:48,310
remember how I opened this
somewhere, you can

4924
00:13:49,517 --> 00:13:51,517
find this rendering

4925
00:13:52,729 --> 00:13:56,020
options. And there's all sorts
of different options, including

4926
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,020
prefers color scheme.

4927
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,020
But here is prefers contrast.

4928
00:14:04,203 --> 00:14:06,203
Nothing for custom, nothing for
more, but you can, you can

4929
00:14:06,203 --> 00:14:08,203
totally do something different
for prefers contrast more.

4930
00:14:08,312 --> 00:14:11,711
Or prefers contrast less. And
then, my media query is kicking

4931
00:14:11,914 --> 00:14:15,213
in. I have done a lot of CSS
nesting because it's fun, not

4932
00:14:15,213 --> 00:14:17,213
just because it's best
practice, yet.

4933
00:14:19,319 --> 00:14:21,319
I think it's great.

4934
00:14:22,617 --> 00:14:24,626
Let's bring down the contrast
change a tic.

4935
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:30,920
And even for me, with normalish
eyesight apart from age-related

4936
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,920
trouble,

4937
00:14:34,525 --> 00:14:36,525
it's already

4938
00:14:38,538 --> 00:14:40,837
for me, you might prefer lower
contrast. But might not want to

4939
00:14:40,837 --> 00:14:42,837
filter all the time.

4940
00:14:42,942 --> 00:14:44,942
We can start using other
colors, of course. I really

4941
00:14:44,942 --> 00:14:46,942
like color mix.

4942
00:14:47,937 --> 00:14:51,543
Because we can use canvas text
and canvas, we can use them as

4943
00:14:51,543 --> 00:14:56,440
mixes with other colors.
So they look good

4944
00:14:59,435 --> 00:15:01,435
both in dark mode and light
mode while only having to

4945
00:15:01,435 --> 00:15:04,929
declare them once. So, for
example, here, if you

4946
00:15:07,925 --> 00:15:09,925
knock out the percentage, which
you can, it just goes to 50/50.

4947
00:15:14,923 --> 00:15:16,923
40 looks good here, so I'll
stick 40 back in.

4948
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:22,430
I'll switch it into light mode.

4949
00:15:26,936 --> 00:15:30,030
And the backgrounds also
lighten up because they're

4950
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:32,030
mixed with canvas and the

4951
00:15:35,436 --> 00:15:37,436
text has darkened, which has
flipped along with my color

4952
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,436
scheme .

4953
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,944
Another way to do it is having
a bit of lower opacity.

4954
00:15:47,652 --> 00:15:51,253
So here, I've got magenta. It's
all red, zero green, all blue

4955
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:56,759
plus O

4956
00:15:58,161 --> 00:16:00,161
opacity of 4, I'm going to flip
it, again .

4957
00:16:00,161 --> 00:16:02,161
Flip.

4958
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,399
So that's one way.

4959
00:16:10,907 --> 00:16:12,907
We can, as we used to, use
prefers color scheme.

4960
00:16:13,602 --> 00:16:15,602
We're totally used to it, we
can do it.

4961
00:16:18,497 --> 00:16:21,584
However, if you're flipping
color scheme, just color scheme

4962
00:16:21,584 --> 00:16:23,584
light/dark with your JS like I
am here, it doesn't change.

4963
00:16:27,462 --> 00:16:31,467
Now, here I've set it so that
when it's prefers color scheme

4964
00:16:31,467 --> 00:16:36,244
light, top one should have a
background of a Teal color. And

4965
00:16:36,244 --> 00:16:38,244
this bottom one should have a
background of

4966
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:41,326
a green with 25% opacity.
And they do not.

4967
00:16:46,117 --> 00:16:48,117
Because prefers color scheme is
only asking the OS, it's

4968
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:51,723
not flipping with color scheme.
Again, we'll go to dev tools.

4969
00:16:53,515 --> 00:16:56,312
Just to prove that it does
work.

4970
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:00,708
So color scheme light coming
on, again.

4971
00:17:05,411 --> 00:17:07,411
We're in a halfway house
because I've got dark mode

4972
00:17:07,411 --> 00:17:09,411
here. These all interact with
each other, and it's so

4973
00:17:09,411 --> 00:17:11,799
interesting.
So, light and back to dark.

4974
00:17:19,395 --> 00:17:21,395
And light, again, the purpley

4975
00:17:22,004 --> 00:17:25,298
colors are going to green
colors. And make it clear that

4976
00:17:25,298 --> 00:17:27,298
it's automatic. Light, dark.

4977
00:17:27,298 --> 00:17:30,677
So it's

4978
00:17:33,668 --> 00:17:36,760
prefers color scheme and the
color scheme property are a

4979
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,760
little bit away from each other
once you start to introduce

4980
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,760
toggling.

4981
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,678
But -- what's coming is
light/dark and it's not quite

4982
00:17:45,678 --> 00:17:47,678
an all browsers.

4983
00:17:47,972 --> 00:17:51,264
It's coming in version 17. 5 of
Safari and there might be one

4984
00:17:51,264 --> 00:17:53,264
or

4985
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,875
two straggler browsers after
that. But it's really nearly

4986
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,875
with us.

4987
00:17:59,862 --> 00:18:01,862
And just to show the
difference, here we have a

4988
00:18:01,862 --> 00:18:05,971
whole media query. Here is
nested within the first

4989
00:18:05,971 --> 00:18:07,971
declaration.

4990
00:18:09,264 --> 00:18:11,264
So it's not too big, but still
is a whole media query

4991
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,679
where it's just saying, when
it's

4992
00:18:16,882 --> 00:18:20,776
light, I want this color, when
it's dark, I want this color.

4993
00:18:20,776 --> 00:18:22,776
And the same here, when it's
light, I want this color, when

4994
00:18:22,776 --> 00:18:25,958
it's dark, I want this color.
And that will work with the OS

4995
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:27,958
flipping to being

4996
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:31,567
dark or light mode and also,
just with it's going to go

4997
00:18:31,567 --> 00:18:36,049
light now. With color scheme.
And back to light.

4998
00:18:37,848 --> 00:18:40,441
And back to dark. Soer, this is
really satisfying for me.

4999
00:18:45,838 --> 00:18:47,838
But this is happily working on
Microsoft

5000
00:18:49,243 --> 00:18:51,243
Edge and Chrome and I think
Fire

5001
00:18:52,459 --> 00:18:55,952
fox and just Safari left to go.
It's so close.

5002
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,560
To summarize, once it lets me
go to the next slide.

5003
00:19:06,853 --> 00:19:09,064
In summary, have a go at using
color scheme light/dark or the

5004
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:11,064
metatag. Either way, it really
doesn't matter.

5005
00:19:15,056 --> 00:19:17,056
If you use the metatag, it's
easier to flip with JavaScript.

5006
00:19:17,056 --> 00:19:20,943
Try using color mix when you're
adding colors

5007
00:19:22,946 --> 00:19:24,946
. Mixing it with canvas or
canvas text.

5008
00:19:27,251 --> 00:19:29,251
Have a go at supporting user
contrast preferences.

5009
00:19:32,157 --> 00:19:35,760
And look forward to light/dark
like I am. And then, just

5010
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,760
encourage you to experiment.

5011
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:41,059
Because it's just changing
these things

5012
00:19:42,669 --> 00:19:45,972
are quite easy things to
change. You need to experiment

5013
00:19:45,972 --> 00:19:47,972
to see what works with what and
how you can adjust things

5014
00:19:49,071 --> 00:19:51,071
and what looks good in dark and
light at the same time .

5015
00:19:53,571 --> 00:19:55,571
I find it immensely fun to play
with.

5016
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:59,882
So I'm glad to share it with
you. And I hope you fine it fun

5017
00:19:59,882 --> 00:20:01,882
to play with.

5018
00:20:06,987 --> 00:20:10,293
The takeaway, is to offer
choice. Just with the dark

5019
00:20:10,293 --> 00:20:12,293
mode/light mode and the more
contrast/

5020
00:20:13,388 --> 00:20:15,388
less contrast you have four
different themes already

5021
00:20:16,993 --> 00:20:20,201
. And if you decide to do
something for, well, that would

5022
00:20:20,201 --> 00:20:22,201
be normal contrast, I suppose,
and less contrast,

5023
00:20:23,302 --> 00:20:25,612
if you decide to do something
extra for more contrast, then

5024
00:20:25,612 --> 00:20:27,612
you've got 6. Yeah.

5025
00:20:29,225 --> 00:20:31,427
I mean, and you've got 6 themes
all at once.

5026
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:36,633
On my home page, I added a
border to everything

5027
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:39,737
in canvas or canvas text
depending on whether it's dark

5028
00:20:39,737 --> 00:20:41,737
or light mode.

5029
00:20:42,961 --> 00:20:45,973
And it's brilliant. It shows
everything extremely contrasty.

5030
00:20:45,973 --> 00:20:47,973
That's it.

5031
00:20:48,075 --> 00:20:51,486
I hope you have some fun
playing with it.

5032
00:20:51,486 --> 00:20:53,793
There's -- I'll share these
slides. I obviously stand on

5033
00:20:53,793 --> 00:20:55,793
the shoulders of giants.

5034
00:20:57,103 --> 00:20:59,210
There's so many people whose
stuff I've read and digested.

5035
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:05,519
And some people have digested
my previous stuff and come,

5036
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:07,519
again, with better, written it
better than I did

5037
00:21:08,617 --> 00:21:11,818
. So please follow a few links
and thank you, I'm

5038
00:21:14,925 --> 00:21:16,925
really honored to have taken
part in the 11ty Conference

5039
00:21:18,127 --> 00:21:21,231
, huge thank to the crew, Mike,
David, and I can see here in

5040
00:21:21,231 --> 00:21:23,231
the studio,

5041
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,351
captioner Diane, because that's
work, and thank you very much.

5042
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:28,351
And hope to see you, any of
you, again. Thank you.

5043
00:21:28,351 --> 00:21:31,182
≫ MIKE: Thanks, Sara. Amazing.

5044
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,590
Yeah. I learned a lot.

5045
00:21:37,199 --> 00:21:39,211
I've just been doing the --
I've been doing the basics of

5046
00:21:39,211 --> 00:21:41,211
light/dark mode.

5047
00:21:43,527 --> 00:21:45,527
It's just fascinating how far
you can take that.

5048
00:21:50,651 --> 00:21:52,651
I didn't know about light/dark,
a lot of those things .

5049
00:21:54,766 --> 00:21:56,766
≫ SARA: Oddly, I find this to
be more basic, just these

5050
00:21:56,766 --> 00:21:58,766
couple of properties have made
so much of it way easier, now

5051
00:21:58,766 --> 00:22:00,766
you've got a bigger play room
to jump into.

5052
00:22:03,191 --> 00:22:06,597
≫ MIKE: Yeah, and being able to
do it without any CSS at all,

5053
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,727
I didn't realize that was
possible. Yeah.

5054
00:22:09,727 --> 00:22:11,727
≫ SARA: Right?

5055
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:15,041
It was a surprise to me, too,
just like, oh, I didn't have to

5056
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:17,041
style all that dark stuff
myself.

5057
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:19,041
It already had it.
[ Laughter ]

5058
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:21,041
≫ MIKE: Awesome. I've got to
play around with it.

5059
00:22:21,979 --> 00:22:24,078
Yeah, it's going to be a lot of
fun. Thanks, again, for

5060
00:22:24,078 --> 00:22:26,493
joining, Sara. It was awesome.
≫ SARA: Thank you so much.
