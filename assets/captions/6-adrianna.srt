2841
00:00:03,092 --> 00:00:05,092
So as I was just introduced,
I'm the director of product

2842
00:00:05,092 --> 00:00:07,092
management, I've never been a
professional web developer but

2843
00:00:07,092 --> 00:00:09,588
always worked with developers.
I've always loved hacking web

2844
00:00:09,588 --> 00:00:11,588
stuff, and I think that --

2845
00:00:12,676 --> 00:00:14,676
for people like me, who have
always been sort of adjacent to

2846
00:00:16,579 --> 00:00:18,579
technology but not like always
like knee deep in it, this is

2847
00:00:18,579 --> 00:00:20,579
sort of like who it's for.
Some interesting stats.

2848
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,560
Before I started learning 11ty

2849
00:00:26,647 --> 00:00:29,735
, I had maybe built one site
over five years . It was a

2850
00:00:29,735 --> 00:00:31,735
Gatsby site, and it made me

2851
00:00:32,744 --> 00:00:36,032
cry, and I just sort of like --
never went back to it. Never

2852
00:00:36,032 --> 00:00:40,727
wanted to do anything. Didn't
want to update it, I was

2853
00:00:40,727 --> 00:00:45,310
fearful  I would break stuff.
And for various reasons, I

2854
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,310
started following Zach on
Twitter and

2855
00:00:48,201 --> 00:00:50,201
I was like, well, this seems
cool, I should give it a shot.

2856
00:00:51,691 --> 00:00:53,787
And I've actually built maybe 5
sites over 5 months. So that's

2857
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:55,787
been really, really fun. And I
started thinking, why is that ?

2858
00:00:58,569 --> 00:01:00,569
Why is it I got so far with one
tool but not others?

2859
00:01:03,551 --> 00:01:05,551
I've tried tons of different
frameworks, site

2860
00:01:06,955 --> 00:01:10,048
generators, and I think for me,
it's that it was just -- it

2861
00:01:10,048 --> 00:01:12,048
feels so much

2862
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:15,130
harder, not easier to build a
site in

2863
00:01:16,335 --> 00:01:20,342
2024 compared to 2000 when, I
guess, I built my very first

2864
00:01:20,342 --> 00:01:22,342
website, you know, hacking
around, changing HTML

2865
00:01:23,231 --> 00:01:25,231
and the CSS and stuff and being
like, this is really fun.

2866
00:01:28,209 --> 00:01:30,209
But then, at some point, it
stopped feeling

2867
00:01:31,297 --> 00:01:33,297
fun or it started to feel like
it was harder to find fun

2868
00:01:33,297 --> 00:01:36,096
things. And getting to build
sites with 11ty

2869
00:01:38,403 --> 00:01:40,403
brought back some of that joy.

2870
00:01:42,114 --> 00:01:44,114
So then I started thinking, why
is that? And how can we help

2871
00:01:44,114 --> 00:01:46,114
other people feel that way?

2872
00:01:46,699 --> 00:01:48,699
The same sense of, OK, this is
something cool I want to learn,

2873
00:01:48,699 --> 00:01:50,699
again.

2874
00:01:51,086 --> 00:01:54,178
And my theory is that there's
probably too much to learn,

2875
00:01:54,178 --> 00:01:56,178
people are not sure where to
pick up if you're not in

2876
00:01:56,178 --> 00:01:58,178
industry, there's so many
tools, so many frameworks, you

2877
00:01:58,178 --> 00:02:00,834
need to know a bit of JS to get
going to get anything done at

2878
00:02:00,834 --> 00:02:04,819
all.
There's also a lot of conflicts

2879
00:02:04,819 --> 00:02:06,819
advice on what you should do
and a lot of

2880
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:10,997
this advice is about how to get
into the industry and how to be

2881
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:13,982
a web developer ? How to make
money? And many of us got into

2882
00:02:13,982 --> 00:02:15,982
it because it was fun. So can
it be fun, again?

2883
00:02:17,769 --> 00:02:19,769
So I actually really think so.

2884
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:23,958
I think that we can sort of
tweak maybe through

2885
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:25,958
documentation and through the
way we like approach

2886
00:02:28,137 --> 00:02:30,137
tutorials to make 11ty

2887
00:02:31,223 --> 00:02:33,223
approachable to people who are
not web developers who don't

2888
00:02:33,223 --> 00:02:35,223
think they are . And, you know,
sometimes,

2889
00:02:37,516 --> 00:02:40,607
I don't like the word like
nontechnical because it feels

2890
00:02:40,607 --> 00:02:42,607
like it excludes people who
don't feel they're technical

2891
00:02:42,607 --> 00:02:44,607
enough and certainly, for me, I
think one of the reasons why I

2892
00:02:44,607 --> 00:02:46,607
didn't really

2893
00:02:47,618 --> 00:02:51,023
like go knee deep into web dev
because growing up, I was told,

2894
00:02:51,023 --> 00:02:53,520
you're a girl, you can't do
math, you don't know how to do

2895
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,520
stuff, you shouldn't be a web
developer.

2896
00:02:57,097 --> 00:03:00,302
I do think having more
inclusive approach to things

2897
00:03:00,302 --> 00:03:02,302
will

2898
00:03:05,707 --> 00:03:09,690
help other people want to learn
this and this seems doable.

2899
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,690
And when I announced I'm moving
off my

2900
00:03:13,094 --> 00:03:15,094
microblog, I was using a
microblog thing, which is good,

2901
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:17,094
by the

2902
00:03:17,094 --> 00:03:19,094
way, I recommend that to people
who don't know how to build

2903
00:03:19,094 --> 00:03:21,094
sites from scratch.

2904
00:03:21,664 --> 00:03:24,754
For my photography website, and
someone emailed me and said, I

2905
00:03:24,754 --> 00:03:26,754
want to microblog because you
used it, it was really cool,

2906
00:03:26,754 --> 00:03:28,754
now 11ty, I also want to try
that. But I really don't know

2907
00:03:28,754 --> 00:03:30,754
where to start.

2908
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:33,349
So how do we get people to
start here with 11ty?

2909
00:03:36,243 --> 00:03:38,243
So I think that this was the
right tool because a lot of

2910
00:03:38,243 --> 00:03:40,243
things are like you said, like

2911
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:44,524
Zach said earlier, HTML first.
Many things work like expected.

2912
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:46,524
It's not filtered through some
opinionated thing.

2913
00:03:47,124 --> 00:03:50,616
You can learn as much or as
little as you want. So could we

2914
00:03:50,616 --> 00:03:53,825
find a way to help people like
go, here's a bunch of starters,

2915
00:03:53,825 --> 00:03:55,825
here's where you deploy it and
if you want to know more,

2916
00:03:55,825 --> 00:04:00,220
figure it out later. And we
already have friendly

2917
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,220
communities.

2918
00:04:03,513 --> 00:04:05,513
So how do we, then, sort of
take that and go maybe a

2919
00:04:05,513 --> 00:04:07,513
different set

2920
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:10,211
of people who see themselves as
not web developers need

2921
00:04:10,211 --> 00:04:12,211
different sort of, like,
knowledge base or different

2922
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:15,710
sort of documentation or
simplified versions of it.

2923
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:18,914
Or they need to ask questions
at sort of happy hour thing

2924
00:04:18,914 --> 00:04:20,914
maybe on Discord,

2925
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:24,221
maybe these are things we can
do. And I started thinking that

2926
00:04:24,221 --> 00:04:26,221
what would have helped me?

2927
00:04:27,513 --> 00:04:30,602
Even just how I got started in
January when I was learning

2928
00:04:30,602 --> 00:04:32,602
11ty, I found

2929
00:04:33,693 --> 00:04:35,693
that I was referencing
Stephanie

2930
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:39,991
, I was referencing Bob, like
11ty from scratch.

2931
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:45,983
So there's a lot of stuff that,
you know, I kind of have to put

2932
00:04:45,983 --> 00:04:48,681
together and figure out what
worked for me. But maybe we can

2933
00:04:48,681 --> 00:04:50,681
sort of help

2934
00:04:52,482 --> 00:04:54,482
curate them for someone that
feels like an absolute

2935
00:04:54,482 --> 00:04:56,482
beginner. Maybe we could have a
far more opinionated walk

2936
00:04:56,482 --> 00:04:58,559
through. Here's a bunch of
starters, click here, host

2937
00:04:58,559 --> 00:05:00,559
here, you know,

2938
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:04,166
sometimes there's decision
paralysis if we could sort of

2939
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:06,166
help to recuse that, maybe
people could get further with

2940
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:10,082
the idea that they can, if they
can get early success, then

2941
00:05:13,078 --> 00:05:15,078
they might be inclined to want
to try to learn even more.

2942
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:19,870
I also think it would be cool
to write more blog posts about

2943
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,870
things that I learned when I
was

2944
00:05:22,082 --> 00:05:24,082
learning web dev as well as
11ty.

2945
00:05:27,489 --> 00:05:29,489
Really, just beginners, there's
a lot of content out there

2946
00:05:29,489 --> 00:05:31,489
obviously is very centered at
web developers.

2947
00:05:32,484 --> 00:05:35,582
But what if we could talk about
why we picked this thing, why

2948
00:05:35,582 --> 00:05:37,582
we used this tool, what you can
do, and really

2949
00:05:37,582 --> 00:05:40,488
simplify accessible ways. I
think that would be very

2950
00:05:40,488 --> 00:05:42,488
explanatory and

2951
00:05:42,488 --> 00:05:44,488
reach a far bigger audience.

2952
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:49,563
Maybe there could be pairing or
like buddy system and we could

2953
00:05:49,563 --> 00:05:51,563
have a special channel just for

2954
00:05:53,569 --> 00:05:55,569
like newbies to get help

2955
00:05:56,665 --> 00:06:00,668
. Those were just ideas that
came to mind, and I'm

2956
00:06:00,668 --> 00:06:04,870
presenting this so we can
discuss what possible paths we

2957
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,870
could pick up in the future, I

2958
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:10,345
certainly volunteer myself for
a part of it.

2959
00:06:10,345 --> 00:06:12,345
And, you know, really, I'm
interested in doing this

2960
00:06:12,345 --> 00:06:14,451
because I think it's important
to spark joy, again, with the

2961
00:06:17,767 --> 00:06:19,767
web, that right now, if

2962
00:06:21,773 --> 00:06:23,773
the default option for someone
who doesn't perceive themselves

2963
00:06:23,773 --> 00:06:25,773
to be a developer is to put up
a squarespace site.

2964
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:28,710
They don't have very much
control.

2965
00:06:31,403 --> 00:06:34,812
I think it's hard to go from
that squarespace pipeline to

2966
00:06:34,812 --> 00:06:36,812
I'm actually going to learn to
become a web developer

2967
00:06:36,812 --> 00:06:39,687
or build stuff for fun
pipeline.

2968
00:06:39,687 --> 00:06:41,687
And so, how can we sort of help
give people

2969
00:06:42,696 --> 00:06:44,696
the tools or at least
handlebars to get started,

2970
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:46,696
again? On this sort of journey?

2971
00:06:48,481 --> 00:06:50,481
So I personally want to see a
world in which I

2972
00:06:51,684 --> 00:06:55,686
can build things that are fun,
maybe even pointless. I don't

2973
00:06:55,686 --> 00:06:57,686
want to just be productive, I
don't want to just build work

2974
00:06:57,686 --> 00:06:59,686
things. I also want to build
websites, too, for example,

2975
00:07:05,886 --> 00:07:07,886
I'm someone that documents a
lot of Asian Potato chips I

2976
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:11,097
eat. And someone would love an
Asian potato chip website.

2977
00:07:15,288 --> 00:07:17,288
If I genuinely believe that
11ty empowers me

2978
00:07:17,897 --> 00:07:19,897
to do fun stuff like this, I
think it'll be the same for

2979
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:21,897
other people.

2980
00:07:21,897 --> 00:07:25,281
So I'm putting myself out there
as someone who wants to sort of

2981
00:07:25,281 --> 00:07:27,281
help bridge this divide and to
maybe work on new stuff with

2982
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:30,574
the team, either in like
writing more blogs or blog

2983
00:07:30,574 --> 00:07:32,574
posts to help other people get
started.

2984
00:07:34,155 --> 00:07:36,155
So that's all I have.

2985
00:07:37,448 --> 00:07:40,838
≫ MIKE: Yeah, thanks,

2986
00:07:42,543 --> 00:07:45,837
Adrianna, that was great. And I
think you highlighted that step

2987
00:07:45,837 --> 00:07:49,745
really well where going from

2988
00:07:52,737 --> 00:07:55,825
Squarespace where everything's
taking care of you to

2989
00:07:55,825 --> 00:07:57,825
understanding some of the
fundamentals and being able to

2990
00:07:57,825 --> 00:07:59,825
build your own site and through
that, having more control, it's

2991
00:07:59,825 --> 00:08:01,825
such an important

2992
00:08:02,329 --> 00:08:04,329
one that we need to figure out
how we can help people make

2993
00:08:04,329 --> 00:08:06,329
that jump.

2994
00:08:07,116 --> 00:08:09,116
≫ ADRIANNA: Yeah, exactly.

2995
00:08:11,395 --> 00:08:14,884
≫ MIKE: The web's for everyone,
it's an open platform. And if

2996
00:08:14,884 --> 00:08:16,884
you're confined to the CMS
platforms, you don't get to

2997
00:08:16,884 --> 00:08:20,428
experience that.
≫ ADRIANNA: Yeah and it's part

2998
00:08:20,428 --> 00:08:22,428
of taking back control aspect
of, you know,

2999
00:08:23,637 --> 00:08:25,637
building an open web that so
many of us are really big fans

3000
00:08:25,637 --> 00:08:29,334
of .
≫ MIKE: Yeah, and it's so cool

3001
00:08:29,334 --> 00:08:31,334
hearing about your journey, as
well,

3002
00:08:33,143 --> 00:08:35,421
like five sites in five months?
≫ ADRIANNA: Five months.

3003
00:08:36,612 --> 00:08:39,307
≫ MIKE: Really cool. I hope you
keep doing that and posting

3004
00:08:39,307 --> 00:08:41,307
them.

3005
00:08:41,686 --> 00:08:45,267
≫ ADRIANNA: Yeah, I definitely
will, thank you.

3006
00:08:45,267 --> 00:08:47,267
≫ MIKE: Thanks for joining us
today, Adrianna

3007
00:08:48,276 --> 00:08:50,276
. All right.

3008
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:55,764
So we've got our next talk
coming up. In five minutes.

3009
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,350
So, yeah, that was --

3010
00:09:02,554 --> 00:09:04,554
I feel like Adrianna really hit
it on the head there.

3011
00:09:07,141 --> 00:09:10,230
Like it's a big -- ask that
question to the chat . I think

3012
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,230
she had good ideas

3013
00:09:13,318 --> 00:09:15,318
. But how do we make
technologies in

3014
00:09:16,327 --> 00:09:20,820
and the web as a platform more
accessible? Outside of like web

3015
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,820
developers?

3016
00:09:26,511 --> 00:09:28,511
I think,

3017
00:09:31,917 --> 00:09:34,528
I think learning computer
science and web development at

3018
00:09:34,528 --> 00:09:36,528
high school should be
mandatory.

3019
00:09:42,257 --> 00:09:45,344
It's such an important part of
the world now that, like,

3020
00:09:45,344 --> 00:09:47,344
understanding these
technologies, at least to the

3021
00:09:47,344 --> 00:09:51,047
high level how they work is
really important. And it would

3022
00:09:51,047 --> 00:09:54,235
just give a lot more knowledge
and control to everyone .

3023
00:09:56,343 --> 00:09:59,732
As a nondeveloper, use GitHub
is

3024
00:10:02,044 --> 00:10:05,333
not an answer that speaks to
nondevelopers. Yeah, it's like

3025
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,333
they can be a big -- it can be
a

3026
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:10,930
big jump, for sure. A lot of
the, I think,

3027
00:10:14,632 --> 00:10:16,632
that's the other thing about
Git is

3028
00:10:17,721 --> 00:10:21,026
, like, where else do you have
a workflow

3029
00:10:23,929 --> 00:10:25,929
that -- that Git can do?

3030
00:10:29,231 --> 00:10:31,231
Google Docs, you can have some
of those elements

3031
00:10:32,443 --> 00:10:35,856
of a Git workflow, you have
some sort of versioning, yeah,

3032
00:10:35,856 --> 00:10:38,835
and like a history of changes.
You can collaborate with other

3033
00:10:38,835 --> 00:10:40,835
people.
Those are great.

3034
00:10:43,098 --> 00:10:45,098
And like a lot of those ideas
come from

3035
00:10:47,008 --> 00:10:49,008
collaboration sort of workflows
from a version control system.

3036
00:10:52,506 --> 00:10:54,506
But when you get into branching
and merge

3037
00:10:56,712 --> 00:10:58,712
ing and pull requests where you
don't necessarily have

3038
00:10:58,712 --> 00:11:00,712
permission on that document,
but you can still contribute to

3039
00:11:00,712 --> 00:11:05,039
it, like, Google Docs falls
down there immediately.

3040
00:11:09,031 --> 00:11:11,031
So, like for the web and

3041
00:11:12,118 --> 00:11:14,118
for Git, how do we enable these
technologies

3042
00:11:18,325 --> 00:11:20,325
for technical people

3043
00:11:21,417 --> 00:11:25,019
? Git is terrible for new
folks. Yeah, it can be.

3044
00:11:29,408 --> 00:11:31,408
It can be, like, it can be
scary

3045
00:11:34,009 --> 00:11:36,009
. You can

3046
00:11:37,099 --> 00:11:40,187
compare Git to DropBox, it's
easy to get your head around, a

3047
00:11:40,187 --> 00:11:42,187
magical folder, whereas Git,

3048
00:11:43,595 --> 00:11:45,595
I'm suddenly introduced to the
terminal or some sort

3049
00:11:46,675 --> 00:11:48,675
of application, is like these
branching lines everywhere,

3050
00:11:48,675 --> 00:11:50,675
there's like a lot of concepts
that you have to be introduced

3051
00:11:50,675 --> 00:11:55,946
to.
Getting comfortable with the

3052
00:11:55,946 --> 00:11:59,933
terminal interfaces is a hurdle
in my opinion. I'm fine with

3053
00:11:59,933 --> 00:12:01,933
it, but it can be a challenge
for newcomers.

3054
00:12:01,933 --> 00:12:04,815
Yeah, well said. Maybe we can
show nondevs how to run build

3055
00:12:04,815 --> 00:12:06,815
scripts

3056
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,420
inside VSCode, yeah, that's
true, but still

3057
00:12:11,508 --> 00:12:14,715
need VSCode and, like, to use
the terminal and, I mean, it's

3058
00:12:14,715 --> 00:12:16,715
also not

3059
00:12:16,715 --> 00:12:19,323
an all or nothing approach.
Like, if we can make it...

3060
00:12:23,424 --> 00:12:25,424
every step we can make it a
little bit easier, then more

3061
00:12:25,424 --> 00:12:27,424
people can access this
technology.

3062
00:12:33,005 --> 00:12:35,716
So many don't (inaudible) with
Git.

3063
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:45,818
I agree, it's hard to get
folks,

3064
00:12:49,923 --> 00:12:51,923
I love when all this Git stuff
involved, running commands and

3065
00:12:51,923 --> 00:12:53,923
CLI.

3066
00:12:57,429 --> 00:12:59,429
Git is awesome, but
intimidating, maybe 11ty

3067
00:12:59,429 --> 00:13:01,429
community can provide a real
simple introduction.

3068
00:13:03,936 --> 00:13:05,936
Yeah, it's like something we're
thinking about a lot is how can

3069
00:13:08,146 --> 00:13:10,146
we give the power of Git

3070
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:15,955
abstract a lot of the
complexity and then introduce,

3071
00:13:15,955 --> 00:13:19,045
we've had a big debate whether
we introduce new terms or

3072
00:13:19,045 --> 00:13:21,154
educate on Git terminology.

3073
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:25,730
So, like, think of a save
versus a commit.

3074
00:13:30,723 --> 00:13:34,327
I think it would be more ideal
if everyone used the same

3075
00:13:34,327 --> 00:13:36,327
language, which would be
commit, then there's

3076
00:13:36,742 --> 00:13:38,742
no ambiguity or confusion
between those.

3077
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,640
Trust me, it would be better,
too many ideas where the

3078
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,640
product is harder to understand
and use, we've got to speak to

3079
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,640
direct impact. For sure.

3080
00:14:01,412 --> 00:14:03,412
Nice. Yeah, good ideas there.

3081
00:14:07,594 --> 00:14:09,594
DropBox is file storage first,

3082
00:14:11,405 --> 00:14:15,098
yeah, that's a good way to put
it. And different tradeoffs

3083
00:14:15,098 --> 00:14:17,098
because

3084
00:14:18,306 --> 00:14:20,306
of that.

3085
00:14:22,883 --> 00:14:24,883
I worked with

3086
00:14:27,484 --> 00:14:29,484
norm engineers at previous jobs
and they used Git GUI.

3087
00:14:31,582 --> 00:14:33,582
I mean, I use a Git GUI.

3088
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:39,572
I just like seeing on the
screen exactly what's happening

3089
00:14:39,572 --> 00:14:41,572
and, like, I use the GitHub
desktop and

3090
00:14:42,984 --> 00:14:44,984
that gives me confidence I'm
not going to miss something.

3091
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,080
Welcome to the terminal, it
doesn't say anything if you get

3092
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,469
it right and screams at you if
you get it wrong. And also, you

3093
00:14:55,469 --> 00:14:57,469
completely break your computer.
Good luck.
