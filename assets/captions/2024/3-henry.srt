1796
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,295
Hey, my name's Henry,

1797
00:00:02,295 --> 00:00:05,295
the font's name is

1798
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,100
Manuka, I'm a creative
technologist.

1799
00:00:10,897 --> 00:00:14,194
I also spent time in New York
City, based in Denver. Super

1800
00:00:14,194 --> 00:00:16,194
into hand crafted web code,
poetic

1801
00:00:17,397 --> 00:00:19,397
computation, CSS, and most
importantly for today, also,

1802
00:00:19,397 --> 00:00:21,397
shit posting. So thanks for
coming to the talk.

1803
00:00:21,397 --> 00:00:24,079
Digital frontiers,

1804
00:00:28,382 --> 00:00:30,382
Indie web cowboys, owning your
post with posse.

1805
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:33,690
I'm super excited to get
started with this one.

1806
00:00:39,796 --> 00:00:41,796
We were given this vast realm
of self-discovery , philosophy

1807
00:00:41,796 --> 00:00:44,585
and joy and community. But most
of us spend most of our time in

1808
00:00:44,585 --> 00:00:47,889
the bad lands of brain rot and
attention farming and

1809
00:00:50,287 --> 00:00:53,581
doom scrolling and general bad
vibes.

1810
00:00:53,581 --> 00:00:55,581
We break our backs, the foundry

1811
00:00:57,792 --> 00:00:59,792
of algorithmic content as
endeavoring of our

1812
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:04,288
sharing our interests corrupted
into the hollow twin of content

1813
00:01:04,288 --> 00:01:06,288
creation, to trap attention

1814
00:01:07,493 --> 00:01:09,493
spans, list

1815
00:01:10,898 --> 00:01:13,697
the thread emoji digital dams
to harvest scroll inertia.

1816
00:01:13,697 --> 00:01:15,697
However, it's not all bad.

1817
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:19,599
There's plenty of folks who
oppose this mundane and

1818
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:21,599
uninspirational for profit
corporate web, folks who

1819
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:24,103
instead believe in the strange
and surprising web, hand built,

1820
00:01:24,103 --> 00:01:26,103
cell phone web.

1821
00:01:26,103 --> 00:01:28,794
The battle for the soul of the
net is fought upon three

1822
00:01:28,794 --> 00:01:30,794
particular

1823
00:01:31,886 --> 00:01:34,091
stages, well, OK, it's many
stages, but I'd love to focus

1824
00:01:34,091 --> 00:01:36,091
on three of them in particular.

1825
00:01:36,091 --> 00:01:38,091
Holy smokes, I'm killing it.
One, do you own your content?

1826
00:01:41,273 --> 00:01:43,273
If the companies that own the
platform

1827
00:01:46,682 --> 00:01:49,888
disappeared tomorrow or
devoured by the board

1828
00:01:49,888 --> 00:01:51,888
millionaire, would your content
have somewhere to live or also

1829
00:01:51,888 --> 00:01:53,888
vanish ? Two, can your content
go anywhere it wants?

1830
00:01:55,978 --> 00:01:57,978
If I want to find your posts,
do I need to go to a specific

1831
00:01:57,978 --> 00:01:59,978
platform? Or can I find and
reply to and share and

1832
00:02:02,776 --> 00:02:04,776
be delayed by those posts or
that content wherever

1833
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,880
it prefers to dwell, wherever I
prefer to dwell, rather ?

1834
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,880
Three, are you in control?

1835
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:13,975
Can you post anything you want
or does someone decide, for

1836
00:02:13,975 --> 00:02:15,975
instance, that you have a
limited number of characters or

1837
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,070
you can only post images as a
certain resolution

1838
00:02:20,873 --> 00:02:23,975
? What good is a banger shit
post, Mr. Anderson if you can't

1839
00:02:23,975 --> 00:02:25,975
pair it with a gif?

1840
00:02:27,265 --> 00:02:29,265
Those are familiar with what
the heck I'm talking about will

1841
00:02:30,356 --> 00:02:33,862
recognize these as some of the
core tenets of the IND

1842
00:02:36,776 --> 00:02:38,776
Indie web movement.

1843
00:02:40,065 --> 00:02:42,065
You own your demand and can
verify and identify yourself

1844
00:02:42,065 --> 00:02:44,065
across the web, owning your
content, and the specific

1845
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:47,966
subject of today's talk,
publishing on your own site

1846
00:02:47,966 --> 00:02:49,966
first.

1847
00:02:50,345 --> 00:02:53,548
So POSSE, or publish on your
own site syndicate elsewhere,

1848
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:55,548
is the idea that for example,
if I've got a banger

1849
00:02:56,641 --> 00:02:59,729
shit post and I often do, I can
create that post on my website,

1850
00:02:59,729 --> 00:03:03,733
write some software to reformat
and propagate it to other

1851
00:03:03,733 --> 00:03:05,733
common places of conversation,
such as

1852
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:09,146
Mastodon or Blue Sky, no other
places.

1853
00:03:11,532 --> 00:03:13,532
And use additional tools and
standards to make the post and

1854
00:03:13,532 --> 00:03:15,532
the inevitable content
surrounding it because I said

1855
00:03:15,532 --> 00:03:18,545
it was a banger, serialized and
read by anyone in any arena,

1856
00:03:18,545 --> 00:03:20,545
always

1857
00:03:21,749 --> 00:03:23,749
linking back to the home URL
post, which by the way, will

1858
00:03:23,749 --> 00:03:25,749
never change .

1859
00:03:26,136 --> 00:03:28,136
I'll get a little more in-depth
on this, but right off the rip,

1860
00:03:28,136 --> 00:03:30,136
this solves everything.

1861
00:03:36,325 --> 00:03:39,929
I own it, syndicating to RSS
and social media that make my

1862
00:03:39,929 --> 00:03:43,133
posts are good or worthwhile,
which is everyone, engage with

1863
00:03:43,133 --> 00:03:45,133
them in the preferred format
and back feeding

1864
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:48,227
the conversation that's
happening in all of those

1865
00:03:48,227 --> 00:03:50,227
places to my website collects
all of the great conversation

1866
00:03:50,227 --> 00:03:52,227
and engagement in one place.
And there's more wins to be

1867
00:03:52,227 --> 00:03:54,227
had.

1868
00:03:55,423 --> 00:03:58,619
Storing bangers canonically
allows you to be a better

1869
00:04:01,922 --> 00:04:03,922
steward of the web because you
can prevent link rot, thanks,

1870
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:08,216
Twitter, and then, search
engines will learn to prefer

1871
00:04:08,216 --> 00:04:10,216
your site and search results if
they continue following links

1872
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:12,705
back to your site .
So, I can see by your

1873
00:04:12,705 --> 00:04:14,705
individual faces, which

1874
00:04:16,113 --> 00:04:18,113
I can see that everyone's on
board with the strategy for

1875
00:04:18,113 --> 00:04:20,113
posting online.

1876
00:04:20,505 --> 00:04:23,211
In the rest of this talk, I'll
briefly cover a light technical

1877
00:04:23,211 --> 00:04:25,211
implementation of POSSE.

1878
00:04:26,507 --> 00:04:29,008
If you're feeling stoked on a
content syndication strategy

1879
00:04:29,008 --> 00:04:31,008
but not ready to take the leap,
you do have options.

1880
00:04:35,115 --> 00:04:38,507
Such as COPE. So briefly some
alternative strategies are

1881
00:04:41,016 --> 00:04:43,016
COPE, create once, publish
everywhere. It's the default

1882
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:45,016
strategy.

1883
00:04:45,408 --> 00:04:48,501
The problem with posting the
same content everywhere, at

1884
00:04:48,501 --> 00:04:50,501
best, you're growing X number
of audiences on disparate

1885
00:04:52,306 --> 00:04:54,306
folks' sites, fractured digital
identity, there's

1886
00:04:57,113 --> 00:04:59,113
pesos, publish elsewhere and
syndicate on your own site.

1887
00:05:01,103 --> 00:05:04,014
There's actually room for PESOS
as an are archival sense.

1888
00:05:07,212 --> 00:05:09,212
Publishers, the Tweetback
project allows you to collect

1889
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,420
historical posts from the
fractured identities and give

1890
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,420
them a nice forever home
somewhere with a nice lawn,

1891
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,420
careful,

1892
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,733
he's a rescue. Also publish
elsewhere syndicate everything

1893
00:05:18,733 --> 00:05:20,733
to a silo.

1894
00:05:22,514 --> 00:05:24,514
Not because it's a good
strategy but because the

1895
00:05:25,921 --> 00:05:29,531
Indie web folks love a fuckin
algorithm, and you've got to

1896
00:05:29,531 --> 00:05:32,824
love them for it. I'm going to
sprint through building an

1897
00:05:32,824 --> 00:05:34,824
application that creates and
reads content.

1898
00:05:35,327 --> 00:05:38,618
P
We're going to make an app that

1899
00:05:38,618 --> 00:05:40,618
syndicates, capturing
engagement on

1900
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:44,801
sites and rendering the
conversation back on our site .

1901
00:05:44,801 --> 00:05:47,894
Before I get into this, many
extremely bright people have

1902
00:05:47,894 --> 00:05:49,894
gone here before, many of them
aren't speaking today.

1903
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:54,363
I admire all of these people
massively. This would not be

1904
00:05:54,363 --> 00:05:56,363
possible without their talks
and blog posts and their work.

1905
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:00,143
There's a bibliography for this
talk, it's coming, I'll make it

1906
00:06:00,143 --> 00:06:04,152
available after I shut the hell
up.

1907
00:06:04,152 --> 00:06:06,152
Oh, yeah, and the other thing,
I meant to use this talk as an

1908
00:06:06,152 --> 00:06:08,152
excuse to rework the publishing
strategy on my actual personal

1909
00:06:08,152 --> 00:06:10,152
site, but as

1910
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,460
I'm sure many of you can relate
to, I'm still redesigning it.

1911
00:06:15,557 --> 00:06:18,655
That's showbiz, baby, instead ,
we're going to create a

1912
00:06:18,655 --> 00:06:20,655
distinct and memorable

1913
00:06:22,063 --> 00:06:24,063
domain and that's showbiz,
baby,

1914
00:06:25,076 --> 00:06:28,768
or showbiz. baby. Don't worry
about the specific code. It's

1915
00:06:28,768 --> 00:06:30,768
an 11-minute talk.

1916
00:06:30,868 --> 00:06:32,868
I'm going to make everything
available after I get off

1917
00:06:32,868 --> 00:06:34,868
stage.
We'll start by creating an 11ty

1918
00:06:34,868 --> 00:06:37,958
project with two templates. One
that lists all of the bangers

1919
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:39,958
and one that

1920
00:06:41,054 --> 00:06:44,645
creates individual permalinks
for the bangers. You might be

1921
00:06:44,645 --> 00:06:46,645
able to see in the market, if
you can see that, that I'm

1922
00:06:46,645 --> 00:06:48,653
using a format called Hcard as
part of microformats 2, which

1923
00:06:48,653 --> 00:06:50,653
is

1924
00:06:51,751 --> 00:06:53,751
a system of classes that we add
to the HTML to make our

1925
00:06:55,361 --> 00:06:58,369
information structured and
easily parsed by like crawlers

1926
00:06:58,369 --> 00:07:00,369
that come to look.

1927
00:07:02,065 --> 00:07:04,065
This is useful because we can
indicate who wrote the bangers

1928
00:07:04,065 --> 00:07:06,065
and what the useful parts of
each banger are.

1929
00:07:07,766 --> 00:07:09,766
Yeah, microformats  2, I got
off sync with the tabs.

1930
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,370
All of this stuff is like super
well documented online.

1931
00:07:18,276 --> 00:07:20,276
It's a little bit wild west.

1932
00:07:21,176 --> 00:07:24,473
On the topic of
aweuthentication. We use the

1933
00:07:24,473 --> 00:07:26,473
domain as identity and use it
to

1934
00:07:26,473 --> 00:07:29,482
verify other instances of our
identity. Since my website and

1935
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:32,576
GitHub account are both me, I
can verify those two identities

1936
00:07:32,576 --> 00:07:34,576
by linking to my GitHub account
from my

1937
00:07:35,676 --> 00:07:38,773
site and linking back to my
site from my GitHub account

1938
00:07:38,773 --> 00:07:40,773
useing realm A links .

1939
00:07:42,674 --> 00:07:44,674
This is the basis for Indie web
authentication

1940
00:07:46,081 --> 00:07:48,081
. Since I'm the only person
that can edit my website and

1941
00:07:48,081 --> 00:07:50,081
GitHub account, it's reasonable
to assume that both of those

1942
00:07:50,081 --> 00:07:54,287
sources are me.
Once we've verified and back

1943
00:07:54,287 --> 00:07:56,287
linked ourselves different
places online, we

1944
00:07:57,491 --> 00:07:59,491
can use a service called

1945
00:08:01,097 --> 00:08:04,302
Indie auth that can handle
authentication and web mentions

1946
00:08:04,302 --> 00:08:06,302
and add a few lines of code to
the head of our

1947
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:09,399
site to tell the services that
they can go to Indie auth to

1948
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:11,399
verify us.

1949
00:08:12,206 --> 00:08:14,206
Also, oh, there's like -- this
is off script.

1950
00:08:15,907 --> 00:08:17,907
There are some serious power
houses of the Indieweb in the

1951
00:08:17,907 --> 00:08:19,907
chat right now.

1952
00:08:20,815 --> 00:08:22,815
If I'm getting anything wrong,
feel free to rip me apart.

1953
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,125
I specifically used GitHub in

1954
00:08:31,405 --> 00:08:34,501
the realm example because they
have a sign-in example that

1955
00:08:34,501 --> 00:08:37,598
Indie will coopt so you can
sign in securely as GitHub and

1956
00:08:37,598 --> 00:08:39,598
verify that I am my GitHub
account and by extension, also

1957
00:08:39,598 --> 00:08:42,605
my website.
But great, so now we've got a

1958
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,605
website that verifies our
identity using

1959
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:48,507
Indieauth and capable of
telling other services how to

1960
00:08:48,507 --> 00:08:50,507
authenticationuthenticate us.

1961
00:08:51,804 --> 00:08:53,804
Through publishing, it's 11ty,
we could create markdown files

1962
00:08:53,804 --> 00:08:55,804
by hand, but it's still really
nice, turns out, to go to a

1963
00:08:55,804 --> 00:08:59,194
website and click post. There's
nothing that clears the ass

1964
00:09:01,303 --> 00:09:04,702
of sending the Tweet. In this
case, I'm using Erin

1965
00:09:07,808 --> 00:09:09,808
Pereki's micropublish er

1966
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:12,822
er Quill. This will feel like
magic the first time you do it.

1967
00:09:16,025 --> 00:09:19,434
We're going to grab a token and
proceed with our micropub end

1968
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:21,434
point that Quill will speak to.

1969
00:09:23,631 --> 00:09:25,631
So I'm basically, we need to
accept publish requests from

1970
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:29,743
Quill and convert them into
files that 11ty can build. I'm

1971
00:09:29,743 --> 00:09:31,743
going to create, I'm using
Netlify functions for this

1972
00:09:31,743 --> 00:09:33,743
because it's what I know .
Create a file function/micropub

1973
00:09:33,743 --> 00:09:35,743
and add the

1974
00:09:36,431 --> 00:09:38,431
corresponding endpoint to the
head on our in dex.

1975
00:09:40,937 --> 00:09:42,937
HTML, go to this end point to
make publish requests.

1976
00:09:46,144 --> 00:09:49,045
Also, I'll be using GitHub's
octokit tool to converting into

1977
00:09:49,045 --> 00:09:51,045
flat files in the GitHub repo.

1978
00:09:52,143 --> 00:09:54,245
We can grab a quick token from
there, as well. And we can

1979
00:09:54,245 --> 00:09:56,245
throw all of the tokens into a
.

1980
00:09:57,742 --> 00:09:59,742
end file and make them
available, but not public in

1981
00:09:59,742 --> 00:10:01,742
your environment. And then, we
can use them in the micropub

1982
00:10:01,742 --> 00:10:03,742
function.
Here's the function.

1983
00:10:06,729 --> 00:10:09,740
This borrows heavily from
Robert's tutorial publishing VI

1984
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:14,540
writer. Here's the general
vibe. One, listen for post

1985
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:17,633
requests and check their
veritoken matches the one from

1986
00:10:17,633 --> 00:10:19,633
Quill,

1987
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:23,253
publish the content and
template them in a way that

1988
00:10:23,253 --> 00:10:25,253
11ty can work with. I made
markdown files with a timestamp

1989
00:10:25,253 --> 00:10:27,942
in the front matter.
And then, commit both the newly

1990
00:10:27,942 --> 00:10:29,942
created file to

1991
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,350
GitHub and then, also, like a
-- some way to let -- like

1992
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:39,346
basically a JSON file that
contains the most recently

1993
00:10:39,346 --> 00:10:41,346
posted post. I'll use it later.

1994
00:10:44,548 --> 00:10:46,548
But once that function's
deployed, we can sign into

1995
00:10:46,548 --> 00:10:48,548
Quill with our website, feels
amazing, make a post, and then,

1996
00:10:48,548 --> 00:10:50,548
watch

1997
00:10:51,053 --> 00:10:53,053
it magically appear on our site
pending a build set. Publishing

1998
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:55,053
sorted.
Next, we've got to talk about

1999
00:10:55,053 --> 00:10:57,053
web mentions. This is the
conversation aspects.

2000
00:10:59,984 --> 00:11:04,895
From the Indieweb Wiki, it's a
super powerful protocol.

2001
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:10,301
It lets us like, you know,
lightweight way and

2002
00:11:11,407 --> 00:11:13,407
standardized way tell our
friends and colleagues that

2003
00:11:13,407 --> 00:11:15,407
we're referencing their blogs,
et cetera, and lets us know

2004
00:11:15,407 --> 00:11:19,523
when folks are referencing or
talking about our work.

2005
00:11:19,523 --> 00:11:22,836
There's another service called
Webmention.

2006
00:11:26,243 --> 00:11:29,338
io, lets us read web mentions
from all over the web . We'll

2007
00:11:29,338 --> 00:11:31,338
sign up using the same

2008
00:11:32,544 --> 00:11:34,544
Indieauth steps as Quill, add
the mention endpoint to the

2009
00:11:34,544 --> 00:11:36,649
head. If it's feeling
repetitive, we're establishing

2010
00:11:36,649 --> 00:11:39,952
patterns, baby, and throw the
API key on our . end for later.

2011
00:11:40,156 --> 00:11:44,359
We can get web mentions from
other blogs, et cetera, just

2012
00:11:44,359 --> 00:11:46,359
like right off the rip.

2013
00:11:47,655 --> 00:11:49,655
But because this talk is
particularly concerned with

2014
00:11:49,655 --> 00:11:51,655
posting bangers, we need to
work out some way to collect

2015
00:11:51,655 --> 00:11:54,059
and share conversations, likes
B,

2016
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:59,066
and replies, et cetera, from
social media . A free service

2017
00:11:59,066 --> 00:12:01,066
that does exactly that.

2018
00:12:04,571 --> 00:12:09,877
Con VRTs engagement into web
mentions.

2019
00:12:09,877 --> 00:12:12,976
Collecting engagement on the
other sites, et cetera, and

2020
00:12:12,976 --> 00:12:14,976
then, also to indicate and
create posts we can track

2021
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:18,070
web mentions on that was the
like publish on our own site,

2022
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,070
bridgy does that.

2023
00:12:21,378 --> 00:12:23,589
So, OK, once a post is created
and published on our own site,

2024
00:12:23,589 --> 00:12:25,589
we need to do the syndicate
elsewhere part.

2025
00:12:25,892 --> 00:12:27,892
I'm going to use another
Netlify function, it's what I

2026
00:12:27,892 --> 00:12:29,892
know. If you're an API genius
and want to do this a different

2027
00:12:29,892 --> 00:12:33,209
way, you can . The world is
your oyster.

2028
00:12:33,209 --> 00:12:35,209
Here's the function.

2029
00:12:36,512 --> 00:12:39,322
Again, TLDR, 11-minute talk, by
the way. We're going to grab

2030
00:12:39,322 --> 00:12:41,322
the last published note.

2031
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,430
I stored it in the JSON file
like I said.

2032
00:12:45,935 --> 00:12:49,539
Ping Bridgy with a request to
publish to Mastodon and this

2033
00:12:49,539 --> 00:12:52,500
most recent post .
And that's literally it.

2034
00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:59,112
It'll just like Bridgy will
automatically post our posts ,

2035
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,112
I've got -- somebody should've
proofread

2036
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:04,208
this script, bro, holy smokes,
to Mastodon and

2037
00:13:05,309 --> 00:13:07,309
it's like four lines of code
like blue sky, other

2038
00:13:07,309 --> 00:13:09,309
syndication targets, whatever
you want.

2039
00:13:10,114 --> 00:13:12,114
So our flow is now completely
automated from I thought of a

2040
00:13:12,114 --> 00:13:14,114
genius post and I posted it via
Quill to having it published

2041
00:13:17,332 --> 00:13:19,332
on our personal site and copy
out to Mastodon, to whatever,

2042
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:21,332
with a link back to our
original site.

2043
00:13:22,338 --> 00:13:24,338
So, on to the final step here.

2044
00:13:26,043 --> 00:13:28,043
Oh, crap, I've gone a little
bit over. I'm sorry.

2045
00:13:30,454 --> 00:13:32,454
Really cool now, the
conversations from all of these

2046
00:13:32,454 --> 00:13:34,454
different sources are collected
as web mentions.

2047
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:38,564
So we can show all of those
conversations from the

2048
00:13:38,564 --> 00:13:40,564
bluebird, the butterfly, the
elephant, in one place.

2049
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:44,350
So folks don't have to miss out
on a reply because

2050
00:13:45,755 --> 00:13:47,755
they prefer Blue Sky, they can
click back and read everything .

2051
00:13:50,059 --> 00:13:53,264
It's pretty easy to use 11ty
data files, run me the check,

2052
00:13:53,264 --> 00:13:55,264
Zach, to collect

2053
00:13:56,357 --> 00:13:58,357
web mentions as JSON from the
web mention API that I

2054
00:13:58,357 --> 00:14:00,357
mentioned earlier . And then
render them into templates,

2055
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,550
Maxbook has a fantastic
tutorial on this . This borrows

2056
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:08,547
from that heavily, obviously.
And I've included

2057
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:10,547
implementation of that in the

2058
00:14:10,547 --> 00:14:12,547
GitHub repo, again, available
after the talk.

2059
00:14:12,547 --> 00:14:14,834
But that's it. Like, after
maybe two hours of work, you're

2060
00:14:17,829 --> 00:14:19,829
owning all of your content,
you're divested from the whims

2061
00:14:19,829 --> 00:14:22,925
of social media silos and sicko
owners and made the web more

2062
00:14:22,925 --> 00:14:24,925
kind.

2063
00:14:25,221 --> 00:14:28,521
There's a million enhancements
that can be made to this. You

2064
00:14:28,521 --> 00:14:30,521
can follow Cy Sia

2065
00:14:31,614 --> 00:14:34,715
's amazing guide, you could add
media endpoint in case you want

2066
00:14:34,715 --> 00:14:37,907
to post gifs, use microformats
to let folks find

2067
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:44,495
a post from your site back on
to the silo, if you want.

2068
00:14:44,495 --> 00:14:47,589
All the code for today will be
examinable, like, under the

2069
00:14:47,589 --> 00:14:49,589
microscope, whatever, online,
on my personal website, Henry.

2070
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,974
codes in the next couple of
days. Oh, I didn't mean to

2071
00:14:53,974 --> 00:14:55,974
leave that in there.

2072
00:14:57,265 --> 00:14:59,561
Oh, yeah, no, sorry, first big
talk, bear with me. And then,

2073
00:14:59,561 --> 00:15:02,660
yeah, thanks for listening
today. Thank you for 11ty for

2074
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,660
having me and all of these
other amazing speakers.

2075
00:15:07,362 --> 00:15:09,464
I'm literally so honored to be
sharing the estage to these

2076
00:15:09,464 --> 00:15:11,464
people.

2077
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:14,166
I've been looking up to y'all
since I was a wee child.

2078
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,460
Last minute plug, if you 11ty
sickos love personal websites,

2079
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,460
visit us at

2080
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,460
personalsite. es and share
yours.

2081
00:15:25,065 --> 00:15:28,267
You can filter by RSS feed, you
can do whatever you want . Find

2082
00:15:28,267 --> 00:15:30,267
me somewhere JAUP line, Free
Palestine, thanks so much.

2083
00:15:32,373 --> 00:15:34,503
≫ MIKE: Thank you so much. That
was amazing.

2084
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:39,703
Those principles of the
Indieweb are so important

2085
00:15:40,915 --> 00:15:42,915
as we've seen in the past
decade play out.

2086
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:50,048
We really are the ones that
need to push these ideas and

2087
00:15:53,356 --> 00:15:55,356
, as you showed, like 11ty's a
great tool to kind

2088
00:15:55,356 --> 00:15:59,485
of be at the core of that
publishing platform.
