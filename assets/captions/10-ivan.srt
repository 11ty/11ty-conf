4379
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,123
I'm Ivan. This will probably
lean on the more like

4380
00:00:06,123 --> 00:00:08,123
history/theory

4381
00:00:08,617 --> 00:00:10,617
of the talks today, but super
excited to chat about this.

4382
00:00:12,914 --> 00:00:16,121
So my kind of fascination and
love for Chinese type recently

4383
00:00:16,121 --> 00:00:18,121
came about when I was traveling
in Taiwan.

4384
00:00:19,703 --> 00:00:21,703
And if you're a fan of this
creature, there's

4385
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:25,109
a 7-eleven in Taiwan that sells
it.

4386
00:00:27,607 --> 00:00:30,814
I was enamored by this juxta
position of the Chinese type

4387
00:00:30,814 --> 00:00:32,814
VER

4388
00:00:33,822 --> 00:00:37,114
because it reflects the
personality. And I've been

4389
00:00:37,114 --> 00:00:39,114
fascinated in thinking how do
we balance these kind of

4390
00:00:39,114 --> 00:00:41,695
systems together today?
And so, yeah, a little bit

4391
00:00:41,695 --> 00:00:45,302
about me, I'm Ivan, I make
websites, animations, comics,

4392
00:00:45,302 --> 00:00:47,302
but I'm

4393
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:50,507
fascinated in this whole world
of how do we make weird things

4394
00:00:50,507 --> 00:00:52,507
on the internet ? And how do we
communicate and create tools

4395
00:00:52,809 --> 00:00:56,394
and infrastructure to do so?
If you've ever taken a history

4396
00:00:56,394 --> 00:00:58,394
of graphic design or anyone

4397
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,800
's talked to you about type
design, there's a very a famous

4398
00:01:03,004 --> 00:01:05,004
book in the mid 15th Century
called the

4399
00:01:08,009 --> 00:01:10,009
Gutenberg bible that everyone
likes to look and pontificate

4400
00:01:10,009 --> 00:01:12,009
upon. Look at the scripture,
think about the black

4401
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:15,007
lettering. I'm here to tell you
that, you should completely get

4402
00:01:15,007 --> 00:01:17,006
rid of

4403
00:01:18,217 --> 00:01:21,818
the Gutenberg bible, and in the
famous book Patricia Lockwood's

4404
00:01:21,819 --> 00:01:25,406
nobody's talking about Chinese
writing system. The history of

4405
00:01:25,406 --> 00:01:27,405
printing ascends back into 11th

4406
00:01:28,805 --> 00:01:30,805
century China with this worker,
commoner

4407
00:01:32,411 --> 00:01:35,501
named Bichon Hu who created one
of the first examples of print

4408
00:01:35,501 --> 00:01:37,500
making .

4409
00:01:38,894 --> 00:01:40,894
So in Chinese history, there
are four notable kind of

4410
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,300
inventions and print making is
one of them made in the 11th

4411
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,300
century. This is an old bank
statement.

4412
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,791
Made at the time using one
immovable type . And one of the

4413
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:54,885
things interesting about this,
if you look at kind of the

4414
00:01:54,885 --> 00:01:56,885
entirety of the Chinese history
and sort

4415
00:01:57,977 --> 00:02:01,684
of Chinese writing system, it
compared d, is pictograph

4416
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,990
ictal,.

4417
00:02:07,285 --> 00:02:10,296
But here you can see the top
that all of these sort of

4418
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,296
representations started as the
original image.

4419
00:02:14,086 --> 00:02:16,086
You can kind of see on the
left-hand side, there's this

4420
00:02:16,086 --> 00:02:18,086
progression of what a horse
looks like starts very much the

4421
00:02:18,086 --> 00:02:20,273
image of the horse and we get
down to the simplified script,

4422
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:22,273
that's what's being used today.

4423
00:02:24,252 --> 00:02:26,252
What's super fascinating about
this, as well, is that

4424
00:02:27,855 --> 00:02:31,063
the -- when you look at it, the
current standard for Chinese

4425
00:02:31,063 --> 00:02:33,063
language in China 2300

4426
00:02:33,563 --> 00:02:35,563
is used in 5% of websites.

4427
00:02:37,254 --> 00:02:39,254
But during the time when this
was happening, the

4428
00:02:39,254 --> 00:02:41,254
simplification, one of the
things about the Chinese

4429
00:02:41,254 --> 00:02:43,254
languages, there's an old
traditional script, which

4430
00:02:43,444 --> 00:02:46,537
you see is like the standard
script versus the simplified

4431
00:02:46,537 --> 00:02:48,537
and that happened during the
1950s where the CCP and

4432
00:02:51,145 --> 00:02:53,145
Communist Party wanted to
improve the literacy rates of

4433
00:02:53,145 --> 00:02:55,145
the Chinese people.
The literacy rates were super

4434
00:02:55,145 --> 00:02:57,145
abysmal.

4435
00:02:57,838 --> 00:02:59,838
I think more than 90% of people
at the time were unable to read

4436
00:02:59,838 --> 00:03:01,838
. It's really complicated.

4437
00:03:02,945 --> 00:03:06,036
If you've ever tried to learn
east Asian

4438
00:03:06,036 --> 00:03:08,036
language/character-based
language, there's so many

4439
00:03:08,036 --> 00:03:10,832
things to learn. How do we make
this easier? How do we

4440
00:03:10,832 --> 00:03:12,832
incorporate this into a
modernized world? How do we

4441
00:03:12,832 --> 00:03:16,930
think about this?
And so, coming here, this is an

4442
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:20,022
example of what an immovable
type kind of emphasizing if

4443
00:03:20,022 --> 00:03:22,022
you've ever worked with print
making or letter

4444
00:03:23,117 --> 00:03:26,209
press, you would know that you
have in Latin script, you have

4445
00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:28,209
GLIFs

4446
00:03:29,615 --> 00:03:31,615
you have gl

4447
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:36,392
yphs, you have to have all of
the individual characters.

4448
00:03:36,392 --> 00:03:38,392
This is an example of how much
stuff you would need which is

4449
00:03:38,392 --> 00:03:41,390
really terrifying. Even in the
modernization of it, it's

4450
00:03:42,786 --> 00:03:46,081
like, what would this even look
like? So this was just like a

4451
00:03:46,081 --> 00:03:48,081
speculative sketch of a
typewriter.

4452
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:51,791
And so, it's like, you have all
of these characters mapped out

4453
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:55,683
on to it.
The average Chinese dictionary

4454
00:03:55,683 --> 00:03:57,683
has 60,000 to 80,000 words.

4455
00:04:00,271 --> 00:04:02,271
A body font for a Chinese font
would require

4456
00:04:03,473 --> 00:04:05,473
you to have about 8,000 words,
but that doesn't take into

4457
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:10,576
case differences in simplified
and traditional. There's a lot

4458
00:04:10,576 --> 00:04:12,576
you have to deal with and a lot
of history associated with

4459
00:04:12,576 --> 00:04:14,576
this.
There's also a lot of political

4460
00:04:14,576 --> 00:04:16,576
structures,

4461
00:04:17,245 --> 00:04:20,335
one thing, specifically, is
that in this example, the

4462
00:04:20,335 --> 00:04:22,335
Chinese language is comprised
of individual radicals.

4463
00:04:24,646 --> 00:04:26,646
So radicals and also characters
composed of traditional and

4464
00:04:26,646 --> 00:04:28,646
simplified.

4465
00:04:28,646 --> 00:04:31,060
And so, here, this radical
means speech.

4466
00:04:34,252 --> 00:04:36,252
So one of the things in the
basis for the Chinese language,

4467
00:04:36,252 --> 00:04:38,252
it's composed of

4468
00:04:38,252 --> 00:04:40,252
the various radicals that add
up to sort of give meaning to

4469
00:04:40,252 --> 00:04:42,252
the character. And you can kind
of see all of the characters

4470
00:04:42,252 --> 00:04:44,745
above have this speech rad KAG
and they all have words that

4471
00:04:44,745 --> 00:04:46,745
are -- meanings that are
related

4472
00:04:47,836 --> 00:04:49,836
to speech creation, word
creation, or sort of like

4473
00:04:49,836 --> 00:04:51,836
communication.

4474
00:04:52,234 --> 00:04:55,323
This is not like ubiquitously
true across the language, but

4475
00:04:55,323 --> 00:04:57,323
it is one thing really
interesting to consider when

4476
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:01,532
you think about comprising and
creating the Chinese language

4477
00:05:01,532 --> 00:05:03,532
as a whole especially from a
type design perspective where

4478
00:05:03,532 --> 00:05:05,532
you want to sort of
componentize all of these

4479
00:05:05,532 --> 00:05:07,532
characters. But one thing
you'll also notice in this kind

4480
00:05:07,532 --> 00:05:10,124
of creation is that you can't
-- you have to make different

4481
00:05:10,124 --> 00:05:12,124
components for each specific
one.

4482
00:05:13,923 --> 00:05:15,923
For example, even in the
character on the right for

4483
00:05:15,923 --> 00:05:17,923
talking fast,

4484
00:05:17,923 --> 00:05:20,346
ha, there's two of these sort
of smaller radicals on the

4485
00:05:20,346 --> 00:05:22,346
bottom and one on the top.

4486
00:05:22,846 --> 00:05:24,846
And within the components have
to make different

4487
00:05:24,846 --> 00:05:26,846
subcomponents. And so, I think
this is a really interesting

4488
00:05:26,846 --> 00:05:29,244
and theoretical approach when
you consider to like how you

4489
00:05:29,244 --> 00:05:31,244
make UI abstractions or the
ways components exist in the

4490
00:05:31,244 --> 00:05:33,244
UI.

4491
00:05:34,721 --> 00:05:36,721
Is there a way this can exist
for font software and making it

4492
00:05:36,721 --> 00:05:38,721
easier for Chinese ?

4493
00:05:40,114 --> 00:05:42,114
This is aS Ais an example of
the traditional versus

4494
00:05:42,928 --> 00:05:46,218
simplified dichotomy looks to.
One of the main things to

4495
00:05:46,218 --> 00:05:48,218
consider in traditional versus
simplified,

4496
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:51,307
there's political ramifications
around two where traditional is

4497
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:56,321
more present in places like
Taiwan and Hong Kong and other

4498
00:05:56,321 --> 00:05:58,321
locations while simplified is

4499
00:05:58,321 --> 00:06:00,711
in the mainland. That's for
another conversation, but

4500
00:06:00,711 --> 00:06:02,711
something to keep in mind if
you ever have to do

4501
00:06:02,711 --> 00:06:04,711
localization .
Just to dig into what

4502
00:06:04,711 --> 00:06:06,711
specifically where you're
thinking about creating those

4503
00:06:06,711 --> 00:06:08,711
languages for.

4504
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:12,303
And so, now a little bit into
classifications of Chinese

4505
00:06:12,303 --> 00:06:14,888
writing systems. So the way
that we have type systems kind

4506
00:06:14,888 --> 00:06:16,888
of as

4507
00:06:18,895 --> 00:06:20,895
like san

4508
00:06:22,301 --> 00:06:25,397
serif and italicized and all of
that stuff, Chinese also has

4509
00:06:25,397 --> 00:06:27,397
this in the font,

4510
00:06:28,489 --> 00:06:31,697
as well, this is called sunti,
which is based off historical

4511
00:06:31,697 --> 00:06:33,697
precedence in

4512
00:06:34,789 --> 00:06:37,103
the Song dynasty after the name
sonti.

4513
00:06:40,295 --> 00:06:42,295
It alludes to this more call

4514
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:47,207
calligraphy nature. There are
large flat stones, flourish at

4515
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:49,406
the end that is indicative of
old style.

4516
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,600
This is what we would consider
kind of a serif in the Chinese

4517
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,898
world. Next up, we have this
thing called hati which

4518
00:07:00,203 --> 00:07:02,203
translates to black lettering
or black body, and so,

4519
00:07:04,211 --> 00:07:06,211
this more represents kind of
the

4520
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,310
san serif world and this rose
to prominence, mainly in the

4521
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,310
late 2000s as a result of
increased digitalization where

4522
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:13,310
it was like, how

4523
00:07:13,608 --> 00:07:15,608
do we make these characters
like easier to read online?

4524
00:07:17,713 --> 00:07:21,620
We also have this thing called
k iti, less engrained in

4525
00:07:24,724 --> 00:07:26,822
older historical periods, be
but some of the same

4526
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:31,016
flourishes. And the fourth one,
a mix of this kind of old

4527
00:07:33,324 --> 00:07:36,627
songti. You can see here as the
one in the past, we have these

4528
00:07:36,627 --> 00:07:38,627
little flourishes

4529
00:07:39,122 --> 00:07:41,122
and like more sort of softer
notes.

4530
00:07:42,415 --> 00:07:46,023
And so, this kind of gives more
of a different writing style/ I

4531
00:07:46,023 --> 00:07:48,023
think in terms of the bamboo
pendant you would potentially

4532
00:07:48,023 --> 00:07:50,620
be using.
And one of these things, also,

4533
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,620
is kind of

4534
00:07:54,231 --> 00:07:57,125
a classification, which is
translates to kind of artistic

4535
00:07:57,125 --> 00:08:00,414
display or artistic font. And
typically, it describes this

4536
00:08:00,414 --> 00:08:02,414
world of display fonts

4537
00:08:04,422 --> 00:08:06,422
, and like display lettering
that's super fun, very bouncy,

4538
00:08:06,422 --> 00:08:08,422
sort of like hard to define.

4539
00:08:09,724 --> 00:08:11,724
And I think I'm personally like
really interested in

4540
00:08:12,817 --> 00:08:14,817
this because it's like all of
those things can be done really

4541
00:08:14,817 --> 00:08:16,817
well, but where are the things
with a lot of personality and

4542
00:08:16,817 --> 00:08:19,813
depth to them?
And so, how do you use this?

4543
00:08:23,204 --> 00:08:25,310
Default set for English
language contains 230 gyphs.

4544
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,500
In Chinese, you have to make a
lot of gyphs.

4545
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:36,002
What happens with this, the
size of your font file becomes

4546
00:08:36,002 --> 00:08:38,002
really, really large and
becomes really kind of almost

4547
00:08:38,002 --> 00:08:41,395
terrible to use.
And the fact that in China,

4548
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:43,395
there's different character
encoding

4549
00:08:43,395 --> 00:08:46,582
methods that are primarily
used, as well. But luckily,

4550
00:08:46,582 --> 00:08:48,582
thanks to the

4551
00:08:49,687 --> 00:08:51,687
unicode consortium, you can
ignore that and use

4552
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,877
the unicode UTF-8, which will
always work for you given the

4553
00:08:55,877 --> 00:08:57,877
sort of

4554
00:08:58,973 --> 00:09:00,973
as long as your font file is
dwell defined within the font

4555
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:02,973
file specifications. P

4556
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:06,978
And you can always use that,
UTF primarily supports all of

4557
00:09:06,978 --> 00:09:09,972
the Chinese characters that
exist out in the world. But

4558
00:09:09,972 --> 00:09:11,972
luckily, when you use this, you
can actually just define the

4559
00:09:11,972 --> 00:09:14,083
font family inside your CSS
like this.

4560
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,692
One thing to consider, you want
to put the Romanization and the

4561
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:21,692
Chinese characters' names.

4562
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:25,701
Just in case you don't know
which one it's going to map to.

4563
00:09:25,701 --> 00:09:27,701
You want to put it as a
fallback and also always define

4564
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:31,710
your Latin language CSS font
family first.

4565
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,710
There's some interesting stuff
being done in the

4566
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:36,816
Taiwanese world. This is a site
which translates to, there

4567
00:09:36,816 --> 00:09:39,625
exists a font library. We have
a font library, which I think

4568
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,625
is really funny.

4569
00:09:42,927 --> 00:09:46,022
And they have this kind of
experimental API that allows

4570
00:09:46,022 --> 00:09:48,022
you to fetch for a web P file
that provides

4571
00:09:49,123 --> 00:09:51,123
all of these gy

4572
00:09:54,332 --> 00:09:56,332
lyphs for you and checks which
are needed and will only

4573
00:09:57,434 --> 00:10:00,643
send you the corresponding
glyphs, thus decreasing the

4574
00:10:00,643 --> 00:10:02,643
size of it, as well.

4575
00:10:05,446 --> 00:10:07,446
This is sort of a reference for
if you ever want free fonts,

4576
00:10:07,446 --> 00:10:09,446
free Chinese fonts, because
they're really hard to get to

4577
00:10:09,446 --> 00:10:11,744
and really hard to find and
make, this is a great GitHub

4578
00:10:14,257 --> 00:10:16,257
for it call Words Hub free
font.

4579
00:10:18,663 --> 00:10:21,766
And one of the things I've also
noticed, when you look at these

4580
00:10:21,766 --> 00:10:23,766
fonts, all of them in the
beginning have the denotation

4581
00:10:23,766 --> 00:10:26,178
of what foundry made them. This
is Fongjun, kind of like

4582
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,180
founder is the name of it.

4583
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,780
These are foundries of the
various different types of

4584
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,278
files. There's the san serifs

4585
00:10:40,788 --> 00:10:42,788
and the calligraphy

4586
00:10:43,993 --> 00:10:45,993
. You can use this writing mode
that allows

4587
00:10:47,802 --> 00:10:49,802
you to write right to left,

4588
00:10:52,405 --> 00:10:54,405
. You also have this great
thing called font variant East

4589
00:10:54,405 --> 00:10:57,010
Asian. Which is specifically

4590
00:10:58,915 --> 00:11:00,915
for East Asian languages and
scripts. You can move between

4591
00:11:00,915 --> 00:11:02,915
normal and traditional.

4592
00:11:03,921 --> 00:11:05,921
And then, one of the other
things to obviously mention as

4593
00:11:05,921 --> 00:11:07,921
a side note, is that no sans,
which is a project by Google

4594
00:11:10,228 --> 00:11:12,228
and Adobe exist to kind of

4595
00:11:12,332 --> 00:11:15,828
provide language scripts across
the world. And so how do we

4596
00:11:15,828 --> 00:11:17,828
feel about, we feel

4597
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,928
that it BLOJ belongs in the
trash and look for other

4598
00:11:20,928 --> 00:11:22,928
things.

4599
00:11:23,322 --> 00:11:25,322
Really quickly, just some
examples of kind of like fonts

4600
00:11:25,322 --> 00:11:27,322
and use of what can you
actually do this? Or how do you

4601
00:11:27,322 --> 00:11:31,927
pair it with Latin scripts?
This is a comparison of what

4602
00:11:31,927 --> 00:11:36,842
hati and songti look together.
There was a project doing the

4603
00:11:36,842 --> 00:11:39,940
Chinese rebranding of the "New
York Times" and he uses this

4604
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,940
beautiful black letter kind of
alluding to the same

4605
00:11:43,145 --> 00:11:46,157
"New York Times" motif and uses
the same stem/notion for this,

4606
00:11:46,157 --> 00:11:48,157
as well.

4607
00:11:49,757 --> 00:11:51,757
One of the funniest things if
you've been following along in

4608
00:11:51,757 --> 00:11:53,757
the three body problem
discourse, is the type

4609
00:11:57,865 --> 00:12:01,162
serif used in the banner for
the communist party. Everyone

4610
00:12:01,162 --> 00:12:03,162
in China was pissed because

4611
00:12:03,162 --> 00:12:06,271
it needed to be a heavier
weight. And you can see in the

4612
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,271
bottom corner what it should
look like

4613
00:12:09,175 --> 00:12:11,175
. And you can also argue about
the issues in the three body

4614
00:12:11,175 --> 00:12:13,175
problem.

4615
00:12:13,175 --> 00:12:16,377
Here's a really great example
from the Taiwan design expo. I

4616
00:12:16,377 --> 00:12:18,377
love the sort of
constrained/put together

4617
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,480
use of the Latin type that has
these weird

4618
00:12:23,483 --> 00:12:25,483
end traps/contrast together
with the more traditional

4619
00:12:25,483 --> 00:12:27,483
notions of the characters.

4620
00:12:28,177 --> 00:12:31,369
Here's a piece, who did the
Chinese brand identity

4621
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:36,682
for Alice in Wonderland, and
you can see them piecing

4622
00:12:36,682 --> 00:12:38,682
together with the original
characters.

4623
00:12:39,979 --> 00:12:41,979
Here's another poster by a
graphic

4624
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:45,078
designer who takes the original
character and uses the lines

4625
00:12:45,078 --> 00:12:47,078
and glyphs as individual
shapes.

4626
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:51,889
Just a couple more examples.
One thing I wanted to mention

4627
00:12:51,889 --> 00:12:54,986
in the sort of vein of fun
Indie programming, you can make

4628
00:12:54,986 --> 00:12:56,986
your own Chinese esoteric
language.

4629
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:02,190
This is written in the script
of sort of old Chinese

4630
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:04,190
languages and programs and
compiles to both JavaScript,

4631
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:07,193
Ruby . You can write programs
in Chinese if you wanted to.

4632
00:13:08,992 --> 00:13:10,992
And the great about it.

4633
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:14,290
Since it's defined on the grid
structure, you can always --

4634
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:16,491
they're all monospace by
default. So that whole problem

4635
00:13:16,491 --> 00:13:18,491
is solved for you.

4636
00:13:21,688 --> 00:13:23,688
Lastly, I wanted to sort of end
with this talk

4637
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:26,779
. This is a characters that
means to add oil.

4638
00:13:29,488 --> 00:13:31,488
But encourage everyone sort of
to, you know, if there's

4639
00:13:32,689 --> 00:13:34,689
any interest, dig into these
things, look at Chinese

4640
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:36,689
characters, think about
different scripts in the world

4641
00:13:36,689 --> 00:13:38,689
and how you can use them to
benefit your

4642
00:13:38,689 --> 00:13:40,689
own designs and your own sites.
So thank you.

4643
00:13:44,403 --> 00:13:46,403
≫ MIKE: That was really cool.

4644
00:13:49,196 --> 00:13:51,196
Just a whole world you brought
us into.

4645
00:13:54,987 --> 00:13:56,987
Yeah, it's fascinating thinking
about that

4646
00:13:58,085 --> 00:14:01,288
difference between the number
of characters and Latin versus

4647
00:14:01,288 --> 00:14:03,288
Chinese

4648
00:14:04,393 --> 00:14:06,393
and the

4649
00:14:08,804 --> 00:14:12,098
necessity to strip it out of
the font sizes. It really is

4650
00:14:12,098 --> 00:14:14,098
like a performance difference,
pretty major performance

4651
00:14:14,098 --> 00:14:16,796
difference that you need the
extra level of optimization on.

4652
00:14:18,792 --> 00:14:20,797
What sort of tooling do you use
to do that?

4653
00:14:24,095 --> 00:14:26,095
≫ IVAN: Yeah, so there's a lot
of kind of like one things I

4654
00:14:26,095 --> 00:14:28,095
mentioned, there's some
experimental stuff.

4655
00:14:30,096 --> 00:14:32,096
There's two font foundries, one
of them called just font, which

4656
00:14:32,096 --> 00:14:36,001
is based in Taiwan. And the
other one is also based in

4657
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:38,001
Taiwan.

4658
00:14:39,299 --> 00:14:41,801
You'll find the interesting
type foundries are based not in

4659
00:14:41,801 --> 00:14:45,101
mainland China because of
various political reasons.

4660
00:14:45,101 --> 00:14:47,101
But they're providing like
experimental APIs that allow

4661
00:14:47,101 --> 00:14:49,101
you to do that . But honestly,
if you're doing it on kind of

4662
00:14:49,101 --> 00:14:51,506
like a one -off site or
project, you can just download

4663
00:14:54,615 --> 00:14:57,224
an OTF or raw file and use it
regularly as a font file.

4664
00:14:58,026 --> 00:15:00,238
≫ MIKE: Got it. Ivan, thanks
again for joining. That was

4665
00:15:00,238 --> 00:15:02,238
fantastic.

4666
00:15:02,243 --> 00:15:04,247
≫ IVAN: Thank you so much.
