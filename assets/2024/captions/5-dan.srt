2494
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,409
The town of Question Mark,
Ohio, is

2495
00:00:03,409 --> 00:00:06,613
located in the Southeast corner
of the state 12 miles north of

2496
00:00:06,613 --> 00:00:08,613
the Ohio River, nestled

2497
00:00:10,021 --> 00:00:12,021
to woods, next to a
breathtaking waterfall, a

2498
00:00:13,111 --> 00:00:16,317
monument of battalion of
British soldiers and the

2499
00:00:16,317 --> 00:00:18,317
remains of a French settlement
that disappeared a hundred

2500
00:00:18,317 --> 00:00:22,397
years before that.
The quaint downtown of question

2501
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:24,397
mark features a beautiful town
hall

2502
00:00:25,804 --> 00:00:27,804
rebuilt three times after fires
destroyed the previous two, a

2503
00:00:29,213 --> 00:00:31,213
magnificent library, and a
clock tower that stopped

2504
00:00:31,213 --> 00:00:33,213
working in the 1960s .

2505
00:00:33,706 --> 00:00:37,512
These were all built from the
fortunes of the Wylie Family,

2506
00:00:37,512 --> 00:00:40,708
town founders and creators of
the Wiley Safety

2507
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:47,212
Envelope now in the cemetery at
the northwest corner of town

2508
00:00:48,305 --> 00:00:51,610
. The drive-in theater, bowling
alley, convenience store, two

2509
00:00:54,604 --> 00:00:56,604
cults, four murders, and seven

2510
00:00:58,209 --> 00:01:00,209
mysterious voids that sit at
the spiralling center of a

2511
00:01:00,209 --> 00:01:02,209
series of mysteries that have
beset the town over the last

2512
00:01:02,209 --> 00:01:04,209
year.

2513
00:01:05,003 --> 00:01:07,003
The town of Question Mark,
Ohio, doesn't exist.

2514
00:01:09,097 --> 00:01:12,184
It's a creation of myself and
the novelist Joe Meno, launched

2515
00:01:12,184 --> 00:01:14,184
in April of last year and

2516
00:01:14,882 --> 00:01:16,882
has unfolded on a near daily
basis in the year since.

2517
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:21,677
It wraps, actually, in the next
couple of weeks . The story of

2518
00:01:21,677 --> 00:01:23,677
Question Mark has been told
across the internet.

2519
00:01:25,664 --> 00:01:27,664
On Instagram, Twitter threads,
The town of Question Mark,

2520
00:01:27,664 --> 00:01:29,664
Ohio, doesn't exist. It's a
creation of myself and the

2521
00:01:29,664 --> 00:01:31,664
novelist Joe Meno, launched in
April of last year and has

2522
00:01:31,664 --> 00:01:33,664
unfolded on a near daily basis
in the year since.

2523
00:01:33,664 --> 00:01:35,664
It wraps, actually, in the next
couple of weeks. The story of

2524
00:01:35,664 --> 00:01:37,664
Question Mark has been told
across the internet. On

2525
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:39,664
Instagram, Twitter threads,
over email, on the phone, and

2526
00:01:39,664 --> 00:01:41,664
most immersively, on the web,
where it's unfolded across a

2527
00:01:41,664 --> 00:01:43,664
sprawling collection of
websites, over 40 in all , that

2528
00:01:43,664 --> 00:01:45,664
have played out like chapters
in a novel, advancing the main

2529
00:01:45,664 --> 00:01:47,664
story while also telling their
own at the same time.

2530
00:01:47,664 --> 00:01:49,664
There's no template for what
we're doing. I mean that in

2531
00:01:49,664 --> 00:01:51,664
terms of the fact that nobody
has told the story like this

2532
00:01:51,664 --> 00:01:53,664
for this long in realtime
across so many different

2533
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:55,974
spaces. But I also mean it
literally.

2534
00:01:55,974 --> 00:01:57,974
Each site is built from
scratch.

2535
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:02,869
There's no cookie cutter
approach to any of it because

2536
00:02:04,273 --> 00:02:07,363
each site is unique, each plays
a singular role in the story

2537
00:02:07,363 --> 00:02:09,363
and each site also has to stand
alone as something real and

2538
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:11,942
believable.
Something that's marked with

2539
00:02:11,942 --> 00:02:13,942
the

2540
00:02:15,345 --> 00:02:17,345
age and ewe till I

2541
00:02:18,156 --> 00:02:21,443
utility of a work a day
website. John colton who wrote

2542
00:02:21,443 --> 00:02:23,443
a song for the story said we
were

2543
00:02:24,648 --> 00:02:26,648
building things as much
artifact as they were art.

2544
00:02:26,648 --> 00:02:28,648
That's exactly right.

2545
00:02:29,113 --> 00:02:31,113
Everything we made in Question
Mark needed to feel lived in

2546
00:02:31,113 --> 00:02:33,113
and real.

2547
00:02:33,911 --> 00:02:35,911
In that way, each site is a
puzzle, a puzzle for the

2548
00:02:35,911 --> 00:02:37,911
audience to solve, but also, a
puzzle for Joe and I as the

2549
00:02:37,911 --> 00:02:40,506
creators. How to make it work,
how to tell the right story,

2550
00:02:40,506 --> 00:02:42,506
how to make

2551
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:47,012
it happen across multiple
screen sizes, and how to do it

2552
00:02:47,012 --> 00:02:49,012
in a turnaround time measured
in days or sometimes even

2553
00:02:49,012 --> 00:02:51,012
hours.
The key was to keep things

2554
00:02:51,012 --> 00:02:53,012
simple.

2555
00:02:54,301 --> 00:02:56,301
Each site was static, either
straight HTML, manually

2556
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,301
deployed on Netlify, or when a
site required a

2557
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:03,515
more complicated structure like
the newspaper with over 150

2558
00:03:04,614 --> 00:03:06,614
stories that span 90 years of
the town's history, that's

2559
00:03:06,614 --> 00:03:08,614
where 11ty came in.

2560
00:03:09,218 --> 00:03:11,218
Beyond that, all of our styles,
we're using tail

2561
00:03:13,428 --> 00:03:16,529
wind CSS, most interactions
were built with Alpine jsx, I

2562
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,529
needed everything in a single
index

2563
00:03:18,943 --> 00:03:20,943
file because keeping track of
anything else was near

2564
00:03:20,943 --> 00:03:22,943
impossible.

2565
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,140
While keeping it simple was
crucial to the endeavor, the

2566
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,140
reality is a lot of what we did
with Question Mark, we couldn't

2567
00:03:28,331 --> 00:03:30,331
have pulled off a year ago.

2568
00:03:33,027 --> 00:03:35,027
We ended up leaning on
generative AI tools for imagery

2569
00:03:35,027 --> 00:03:37,027
more than we thought. And some
of the writing and coding.

2570
00:03:39,312 --> 00:03:41,312
In pushing them to see what was
possible with the tools

2571
00:03:42,926 --> 00:03:44,926
, I actually learned pretty
clearly they're just like any

2572
00:03:44,926 --> 00:03:46,926
other. And skilled hands, you
can do pretty incredible

2573
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:48,926
things.

2574
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,731
Of course, they are not perfect
in many, many ways, but for two

2575
00:03:52,731 --> 00:03:54,731
people with no budget to
imagine a world in near

2576
00:03:54,731 --> 00:03:56,731
realtime, it was liberating.

2577
00:03:58,737 --> 00:04:00,944
We used all of this, old
school, HTML, new school large

2578
00:04:00,944 --> 00:04:02,944
language models in service of
story.

2579
00:04:05,241 --> 00:04:07,241
The story of Violet

2580
00:04:09,252 --> 00:04:11,252
Bookman, a 17-year-old trying
to find her neighbor's cat Mr.

2581
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:13,252
Business.

2582
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:15,545
As readers, that's where we
meet her and we follow her

2583
00:04:15,545 --> 00:04:17,545
adventures through town. We
help her to solve mysteries and

2584
00:04:17,545 --> 00:04:20,232
find allies, even as the story
grows bigger and darker than a

2585
00:04:20,232 --> 00:04:22,232
missing cat.

2586
00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:27,826
But the real story of Question
Mark is one of grief, of

2587
00:04:27,826 --> 00:04:30,923
wishing you could return to a
past that felt better, felt

2588
00:04:30,923 --> 00:04:32,923
more whole, but realize

2589
00:04:35,129 --> 00:04:37,136
ing that to grieve is really to
move forward in spite of

2590
00:04:37,136 --> 00:04:39,136
everything.

2591
00:04:39,136 --> 00:04:41,932
That pattern, this is what the
story's about, and this is what

2592
00:04:41,932 --> 00:04:43,932
it's really about

2593
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:47,351
. How we approached every site
that we built.

2594
00:04:50,048 --> 00:04:52,048
There was the garbage dump, one
of the more complicated and

2595
00:04:54,255 --> 00:04:57,356
janky builds that let readers
dig through hundreds of items

2596
00:04:57,356 --> 00:04:59,356
of trash to uncover a long
buried container of

2597
00:04:59,356 --> 00:05:01,555
toxic sludge. But really, the
dump was the story the town's

2598
00:05:01,555 --> 00:05:03,555
long time

2599
00:05:04,657 --> 00:05:06,657
mayor finally coming to terms
with the scale of her dead

2600
00:05:06,657 --> 00:05:08,657
husband's corruption.

2601
00:05:10,468 --> 00:05:12,468
There was the experimental crop
stations

2602
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,563
online course catalog, where
you could actually take an

2603
00:05:15,563 --> 00:05:17,572
entire course on experimental
biology if you wanted to, but

2604
00:05:17,572 --> 00:05:20,658
the real goal was to take and
fail the employee security exam

2605
00:05:20,658 --> 00:05:22,658
in order to free

2606
00:05:23,751 --> 00:05:26,632
the sentient bean made of light
known as queuey.

2607
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,820
There was the Question Mark
motel, which isn't coming up in

2608
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,820
my slides. There it is.

2609
00:05:35,493 --> 00:05:37,493
The Question Mark Motel, which
actually advanced four

2610
00:05:37,493 --> 00:05:40,677
different stories on a single
page. Giving readers back story

2611
00:05:40,677 --> 00:05:42,677
on a number of different
characters simply by clicking

2612
00:05:42,677 --> 00:05:44,677
on the room. But really, it was
the story of one room.

2613
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:52,491
Room O, and the cult that had
taken up residence there. And

2614
00:05:52,491 --> 00:05:55,792
their plan to commit a murder
on the eclipse. And then, there

2615
00:05:55,792 --> 00:05:57,792
was Bookman's music.

2616
00:05:59,089 --> 00:06:02,185
The music store run by Violet
Bookman's father . We knew we

2617
00:06:02,185 --> 00:06:04,185
wanted to bring readers into
the store

2618
00:06:05,392 --> 00:06:07,392
the same way we brought readers
into the ice cream shop, the

2619
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:10,290
chicken joint and the pet shop
and many other locations in

2620
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:12,290
town.
We also wanted to reveal a fun

2621
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,290
detail about

2622
00:06:15,096 --> 00:06:17,096
Todd Bookman, he was in a one
hit wonder band

2623
00:06:18,186 --> 00:06:21,571
called Matrix who charted with
their song called ticking away.

2624
00:06:21,571 --> 00:06:23,571
Jonathan Colton wrote and
recorded that song for us.

2625
00:06:23,954 --> 00:06:27,247
What was the site really about?
It was about a way to explore

2626
00:06:27,247 --> 00:06:29,247
the distance between

2627
00:06:30,852 --> 00:06:32,852
Violet and her father that
emerged in the shadow

2628
00:06:33,261 --> 00:06:36,849
of the death of her mother four
years ago.

2629
00:06:36,849 --> 00:06:38,849
We hid that story throughout
the site and encouraged people

2630
00:06:38,849 --> 00:06:41,435
to interact and explore. Fill
out the form for music lessons,

2631
00:06:41,435 --> 00:06:43,435
and you

2632
00:06:44,127 --> 00:06:47,421
get an entry from Violet's
journals. Start inquiring about

2633
00:06:47,421 --> 00:06:49,421
instruments, and you'd get
another

2634
00:06:49,635 --> 00:06:52,330
entry delivered line by line.
You learn how distant she and

2635
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:54,330
her dad have become.

2636
00:06:55,621 --> 00:06:57,621
She writes, maybe I'm just
afraid to have a relationship

2637
00:06:57,621 --> 00:06:59,621
with him because that would
mean admitting my mom isn't

2638
00:06:59,621 --> 00:07:02,227
ever coming back. On the about
page, we

2639
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,740
reversed that point of view and
hear from Violet's father.

2640
00:07:09,034 --> 00:07:11,846
Click on the images of his late
wife and Violet as a child, and

2641
00:07:11,846 --> 00:07:13,846
you learn how he's been dealing
with the death.

2642
00:07:15,437 --> 00:07:17,437
I know I've been distant, he
writes, but I know both of

2643
00:07:18,531 --> 00:07:21,919
us needed to find answers in
our own way. I know I've been

2644
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,919
afraid to talk about the pain
both of us are dealing with and

2645
00:07:25,123 --> 00:07:27,123
I know in just a few months,
she's going to be leaving for

2646
00:07:27,123 --> 00:07:29,123
college.

2647
00:07:30,313 --> 00:07:32,696
The Bookmans' music site came
together in two days. We

2648
00:07:32,696 --> 00:07:35,687
started with the story and all
grew from there.

2649
00:07:35,687 --> 00:07:37,687
It launched and we were already
on to the next chapter.

2650
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:42,318
There are dozens of examples
like this. Because nothing in

2651
00:07:42,318 --> 00:07:44,318
Question Mark is what it
appears.

2652
00:07:45,611 --> 00:07:47,611
Almost everything has a deeper
connection to the story or to

2653
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,509
the characters or to the theme
of loss and grief.

2654
00:07:54,508 --> 00:07:56,508
I have made a lot of websites
in the last year, and I will be

2655
00:07:56,508 --> 00:07:58,508
honest with you, I code with a
cat caught in a paper

2656
00:07:58,508 --> 00:08:01,403
bag. I am not here to tell you
about web standards or creating

2657
00:08:04,397 --> 00:08:07,497
elegant, efficient code, lift
the hood on any of these sites

2658
00:08:07,497 --> 00:08:12,693
that I've made, and they are a
horror show, but that is OK.

2659
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:15,786
Because every site worked for
what it needed to be. A small

2660
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:17,786
part in a larger whole.

2661
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:22,426
Sure, they were janky as hell,
but they were sites that

2662
00:08:22,426 --> 00:08:24,426
thousands of people wanted to
go to and engage

2663
00:08:24,426 --> 00:08:26,426
in. They definitely did not a
adhere to best

2664
00:08:29,413 --> 00:08:31,413
practices, but instead, they
offered a doorway into a world

2665
00:08:31,413 --> 00:08:33,413
that people wanted to live
inside.

2666
00:08:36,298 --> 00:08:38,298
I love this post from one of
the folks on

2667
00:08:39,391 --> 00:08:41,697
the Discord server dead dicated
to unraveling the mysteries.

2668
00:08:44,884 --> 00:08:46,884
I struggle to make my brain
understand that I can't get on

2669
00:08:46,884 --> 00:08:48,884
a plane, go over there and sort
it all out myself, it's so real

2670
00:08:48,884 --> 00:08:50,884
to me.

2671
00:08:53,391 --> 00:08:56,487
This should be the aim of
anything that you build .

2672
00:08:56,487 --> 00:08:58,487
Create something that feels so
real

2673
00:08:58,693 --> 00:09:00,693
that someone has to struggle to
remember that it isn't.

2674
00:09:03,786 --> 00:09:05,786
That is making a website or 40
of them real good.

2675
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,881
It doesn't matter if you've got
the latest skills or if you

2676
00:09:10,881 --> 00:09:12,881
know the cutting edge approach
to building or the right

2677
00:09:12,881 --> 00:09:15,669
framework or whatever. I had
none hof that when I started,

2678
00:09:15,669 --> 00:09:17,669
and I still do not a year
later.

2679
00:09:21,065 --> 00:09:23,065
Instead, have something to say.

2680
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:26,965
Figure out the best possible
way to say it. The rest will

2681
00:09:26,965 --> 00:09:28,965
follow.

2682
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,945
Every day Joe and I got to sit
down and ask ourselves

2683
00:09:32,945 --> 00:09:35,164
what's the story we want to
tell? And how can we build

2684
00:09:35,164 --> 00:09:37,164
something amazing to tell it?

2685
00:09:39,263 --> 00:09:41,956
And then we'd ask, what's the
real story we're telling? And

2686
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,956
how does this artifact we've
created service that?

2687
00:09:44,752 --> 00:09:46,752
There's that pattern, again,
right? What's the story? What's

2688
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,752
the real story?

2689
00:09:50,846 --> 00:09:52,846
And that's true with this talk,
too

2690
00:09:54,253 --> 00:09:57,355
. Because, yes, this talk is
about the work and love and

2691
00:09:57,355 --> 00:09:59,355
care that went into building

2692
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:02,366
ing Question Mark for the last
year. But what it's really

2693
00:10:02,366 --> 00:10:04,366
about is this.

2694
00:10:04,366 --> 00:10:06,366
The web is still magical.

2695
00:10:07,953 --> 00:10:09,953
It's still a place where you
can build everything you want,

2696
00:10:09,953 --> 00:10:11,953
even a whole town.

2697
00:10:13,461 --> 00:10:15,461
There's no permission to get,
no hoops to jump through, no

2698
00:10:15,461 --> 00:10:17,461
risk of a platform shutting you
down, you don't

2699
00:10:19,773 --> 00:10:22,868
need fancy tools or a big team,
you just need your imagination,

2700
00:10:22,868 --> 00:10:26,883
a text file, a doc type HTML
tag and the whole world is

2701
00:10:26,883 --> 00:10:28,883
there for you to make.

2702
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:32,672
It doesn't matter if it's
imperfect,

2703
00:10:33,477 --> 00:10:36,180
doesn't matter if the edges are
rough. Rough edges are just our

2704
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,180
humanity showing through.

2705
00:10:39,477 --> 00:10:42,884
When people wax nostalgic for
the web, for the hamster dance

2706
00:10:42,884 --> 00:10:46,297
or MySpace profiles, what
they're nostalgic for is the

2707
00:10:46,297 --> 00:10:48,297
web

2708
00:10:48,297 --> 00:10:52,797
before it got all sanded down.
They're nostalgic for a web

2709
00:10:52,797 --> 00:10:56,899
that could give you splinters,
for a web with rough edges. For

2710
00:10:56,899 --> 00:10:58,899
a web that was more human.

2711
00:11:00,188 --> 00:11:02,188
But the story of Question Mark,
the real story is that you

2712
00:11:02,188 --> 00:11:04,188
can't move backwards .

2713
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,250
That the past is the past, and
attempting to return to it

2714
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,586
never works. And that's OK.
Because we don't have to.

2715
00:11:14,972 --> 00:11:16,972
The tools to make a web that's
more human,

2716
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,291
more magical, more amazing are
not the tools of the past but

2717
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:22,291
the tools of right now.

2718
00:11:24,766 --> 00:11:26,766
There's never been a better
time to make something,

2719
00:11:26,766 --> 00:11:28,766
anything, on the web.

2720
00:11:31,743 --> 00:11:33,743
You can build a world, tell a
story, make things happen big

2721
00:11:33,743 --> 00:11:36,835
and small, the web is still
vital, it's still exciting, and

2722
00:11:36,835 --> 00:11:38,835
the rules are there for the
breaking.

2723
00:11:39,609 --> 00:11:41,609
Thank you so much.

2724
00:11:46,308 --> 00:11:48,308
≫ MIKE: So cool.

2725
00:11:49,907 --> 00:11:52,786
I've never seen anything like
that. That was incredible.

2726
00:11:55,193 --> 00:11:57,193
≫ DAN: Neither have I, and I
made it.

2727
00:11:57,193 --> 00:11:59,193
≫ MIKE: Yeah.

2728
00:11:59,193 --> 00:12:02,172
So -- how did this start? Why
did you decide this platform

2729
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,767
?
≫ DAN: So, I have worked with

2730
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,767
Joe

2731
00:12:09,925 --> 00:12:12,816
for many years on and off. He
worked with me on the magazine

2732
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:16,101
Punk Planet, I put out a couple
of books of his. But we have

2733
00:12:16,101 --> 00:12:18,101
not collaborated in probably 15
years.

2734
00:12:20,396 --> 00:12:22,396
And we went on a walk on a warm
November, and he was like,

2735
00:12:23,481 --> 00:12:25,481
I have this idea for a novel,
but I don't want to make it as

2736
00:12:25,481 --> 00:12:27,555
a book.
Kind of want it to exist on the

2737
00:12:27,555 --> 00:12:29,555
internet. And I was like, just
stop, let's do it.

2738
00:12:33,342 --> 00:12:35,342
And then, we figured it out
from there. You know.

2739
00:12:38,923 --> 00:12:40,923
We did not know what we were
getting into when we got into

2740
00:12:40,923 --> 00:12:42,923
it . But it's been a ride.

2741
00:12:48,914 --> 00:12:50,914
≫ MIKE: Is it a sequential
story? How do I navigate

2742
00:12:50,914 --> 00:12:52,914
between the parts of the story?

2743
00:12:54,676 --> 00:12:56,676
≫ DAN: So there are sort of
three main channels that the

2744
00:12:56,676 --> 00:12:58,676
story's told in.

2745
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:01,370
One is Violet Bookman's
Instagram

2746
00:13:03,379 --> 00:13:07,758
account @violet bookman, I
don't remember it right now.

2747
00:13:07,758 --> 00:13:12,051
And then, there's the town
website, which is questionmark.

2748
00:13:12,051 --> 00:13:14,051
town, and the town
announcements that are

2749
00:13:14,051 --> 00:13:16,051
published from there, there
have been about 170, 180 town

2750
00:13:16,051 --> 00:13:18,051
announcements at this point.

2751
00:13:18,723 --> 00:13:20,723
Those are almost always the way
you branch into different

2752
00:13:20,723 --> 00:13:22,723
websites.
There's also the kind of sad

2753
00:13:25,586 --> 00:13:27,586
dad cop in town Ron

2754
00:13:30,195 --> 00:13:32,195
Deblosky who you can follow on
threads now, he was on Twitter,

2755
00:13:32,195 --> 00:13:34,195
but why would he still be
there?

2756
00:13:34,195 --> 00:13:36,871
And then, there's a mailing
list you can subscribe to, but

2757
00:13:36,871 --> 00:13:38,871
the

2758
00:13:39,955 --> 00:13:42,867
best way to get into it,
actually, is questionmark Ohio.

2759
00:13:46,253 --> 00:13:48,253
com, where we are breaking it
down week by week as

2760
00:13:49,338 --> 00:13:51,338
episodes, there are 42 episodes
you can read summaries for with

2761
00:13:51,338 --> 00:13:53,338
all of the links there.

2762
00:13:53,726 --> 00:13:57,014
≫ MIKE: Very cool. Thanks for
joining, Dan, it's a

2763
00:13:57,014 --> 00:13:59,014
fascinating project .

2764
00:13:59,014 --> 00:14:01,014
≫ DAN: Thanks for having me.
See you on the web.
