1209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
Yeah sure, and I’ll go ahead
and proceed

1210
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:06,520
I'm Paul

1211
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,520
Everitt, developer advocate as
Mike mentioned.

1212
00:00:10,623 --> 00:00:12,623
We're going to talk about using
11ty on larger

1213
00:00:13,826 --> 00:00:17,031
projects, but first, I wanted
to give a big thank you to all

1214
00:00:17,031 --> 00:00:19,031
of you to you,

1215
00:00:19,031 --> 00:00:21,640
especially to Zach for this
conference. It's like you

1216
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,640
crawled inside my brain and
found the

1217
00:00:24,844 --> 00:00:26,844
exact speakers and the exact
topics that I would be

1218
00:00:26,844 --> 00:00:28,844
interested in seeing.

1219
00:00:31,727 --> 00:00:33,727
And not only that, Zach created
this community

1220
00:00:33,727 --> 00:00:35,727
around 11ty, which is
fantastic.

1221
00:00:38,236 --> 00:00:41,050
I'm just such a supporter and
advocate for everything he's

1222
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,050
doing.

1223
00:00:44,547 --> 00:00:46,547
And like was mentioned before,
trying to put the web back in

1224
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:48,547
the web. So let's begin.

1225
00:00:48,547 --> 00:00:51,751
We have a website called the

1226
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:57,522
JetBrains guide.

1227
00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:02,628
It has content, we've been
working on it for a while

1228
00:01:02,636 --> 00:01:05,938
while with a big friend of
11ty. And when I started this,

1229
00:01:05,938 --> 00:01:07,938
in 2018

1230
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,849
, I used Gatsby. No, seriously,
please, stay.

1231
00:01:19,063 --> 00:01:21,063
We all make decisions, just
like getting beat up on the

1232
00:01:22,163 --> 00:01:24,163
playground as a kid, you can
learn from your mistakes, but

1233
00:01:24,163 --> 00:01:26,163
we also can learn some of the
things that can take us

1234
00:01:26,163 --> 00:01:28,163
forward.

1235
00:01:28,163 --> 00:01:31,466
I learned a lot about modern
web, good and the bad.

1236
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:33,466
Learned a lot about I come from

1237
00:01:34,571 --> 00:01:36,571
a CMS background, I learned a
lot about modern CMSs.

1238
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:42,377
And there was a point when
Collin came to me and said, you

1239
00:01:42,377 --> 00:01:45,476
know, really everyone hates you
about this Gatsby thing and so,

1240
00:01:45,476 --> 00:01:47,476
you really got to make a change
here.

1241
00:01:49,265 --> 00:01:52,564
Let's go to 11ty. But we wanted
to keep the developer

1242
00:01:52,564 --> 00:01:55,568
experience we had from the
tooling . We wanted to keep

1243
00:01:55,568 --> 00:01:57,568
some of the author experience
that we had.

1244
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:00,869
So we went away and added some
of the

1245
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:04,088
things to 11ty and
realistically, that's the talk

1246
00:02:04,088 --> 00:02:06,088
for today, what did we do with
11ty to support things that

1247
00:02:09,261 --> 00:02:11,261
you might want to do with a
Gatsby

1248
00:02:12,663 --> 00:02:15,269
. Things you might want to do
with a CMS. Things you might

1249
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:17,269
want to do with a larger
system.

1250
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:22,374
What do I mean?

1251
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:25,676
We rolled out a codebase that
used typescript and used a

1252
00:02:25,676 --> 00:02:27,676
templating language, TSX.

1253
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:31,792
JSX, TSX. As an 11ty template

1254
00:02:35,501 --> 00:02:37,501
ing language, not as a browser
rendered templating language.

1255
00:02:40,309 --> 00:02:42,309
We also added in, I like to do
tests

1256
00:02:43,408 --> 00:02:45,408
-first development, we added in
V test, and friends, the

1257
00:02:45,408 --> 00:02:47,408
friends we'll cover in a
moment.

1258
00:02:48,974 --> 00:02:52,181
And some other stuff I hope
we'll have time to get to about

1259
00:02:52,181 --> 00:02:55,390
improving the author experience
with automatically generating

1260
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:57,390
JSON schema, and then, one of
the things I kind

1261
00:02:58,491 --> 00:03:00,698
of was intrigued about from
Gatsby was its GraphQL query

1262
00:03:00,698 --> 00:03:02,698
model.

1263
00:03:05,294 --> 00:03:07,294
One little point, if you're
ever doing GraphQL

1264
00:03:08,395 --> 00:03:11,492
and you -- and Gatsby, and you
think you want to do custom

1265
00:03:11,492 --> 00:03:13,492
GraphQL schema extensions,
don't.

1266
00:03:14,102 --> 00:03:16,102
All right.

1267
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:22,418
The real philosophy P behind
this is, doing your web

1268
00:03:22,418 --> 00:03:24,418
development in small little
chunks so you can stay in the

1269
00:03:24,418 --> 00:03:27,490
flow. And you're not like doing
a whole build with console

1270
00:03:30,592 --> 00:03:32,592
logs and poking around hoping
to stumbling across the problem

1271
00:03:32,592 --> 00:03:35,011
that you're having.
Instead, it feels like

1272
00:03:35,011 --> 00:03:37,011
development with joy.

1273
00:03:40,518 --> 00:03:42,518
As I go through this, you don't
have to follow

1274
00:03:43,627 --> 00:03:47,432
along too closely, I'm going to
go pretty fast through the how

1275
00:03:47,432 --> 00:03:49,432
and try to get more to the
demos that show a little bit

1276
00:03:49,432 --> 00:03:51,432
more of the why .
And the reason you don't have

1277
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:53,432
to is because we put up

1278
00:03:54,161 --> 00:03:56,161
an 8-part tutorial with text
and code and

1279
00:03:58,401 --> 00:04:00,401
videos walking through each one
of the steps that I'm going to

1280
00:04:00,401 --> 00:04:02,401
go through a little bit today.

1281
00:04:04,213 --> 00:04:06,213
I'll take a look over here and
see if there's anything I need

1282
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:08,213
to catch up on in comments, as
well.

1283
00:04:10,026 --> 00:04:12,026
With that in mind, let's do a
quick tour of how we got to

1284
00:04:12,026 --> 00:04:14,026
tooling.

1285
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,650
For 11ty. First in the package
.

1286
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,067
json as Zach mentioned in the
opening remarks, we started

1287
00:04:22,067 --> 00:04:24,067
with ESM modules.

1288
00:04:24,067 --> 00:04:26,067
This was something in 3. 0 that
we got when we did this in 2.

1289
00:04:28,915 --> 00:04:30,915
0, we had to stick with
CommonJS.

1290
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:37,021
The hero of the show is a
package called TS X, and it is

1291
00:04:37,021 --> 00:04:39,021
a layer on top of ES build

1292
00:04:40,429 --> 00:04:42,429
that gives you a bunch of
sensible defaults so that you

1293
00:04:42,429 --> 00:04:44,429
don't have to think about it so
much, which is good because I

1294
00:04:44,429 --> 00:04:46,429
don't really understand a lot
of these decisions.

1295
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,740
And it winds up feeling like a
Node replacement.

1296
00:04:54,454 --> 00:04:56,454
The command node, obviously,
it's running node under the

1297
00:04:56,454 --> 00:04:58,454
hood,

1298
00:04:58,454 --> 00:05:00,454
but you run TSX instead and you
inherit all of this stuff.

1299
00:05:03,277 --> 00:05:06,886
Then, we needed something to
render a VDOM, I guess, is the

1300
00:05:06,886 --> 00:05:08,886
best way to put it

1301
00:05:09,495 --> 00:05:11,800
into a string, and this is the
package we used. It had a

1302
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,800
number of things that we really
needed.

1303
00:05:14,217 --> 00:05:16,217
Versus a package we were using
before.

1304
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,734
What this means, we're not
using React anywhere.

1305
00:05:23,844 --> 00:05:25,844
There's no React, Preact,

1306
00:05:28,649 --> 00:05:30,649
this package renders or JSX
into a string.

1307
00:05:33,963 --> 00:05:35,963
And then for the component
driven development workflow, we

1308
00:05:35,963 --> 00:05:37,963
like to sit in tests . So V

1309
00:05:39,971 --> 00:05:42,478
test is a wonderful package and
it's super speedy. Friends came

1310
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:46,389
along for the ride with V test.
A browser called Happy DOM and

1311
00:05:49,494 --> 00:05:51,494
testing library that has a
philosophy of testing your site

1312
00:05:51,494 --> 00:05:53,494
the way people use it.

1313
00:05:54,707 --> 00:05:56,707
In an accessibility oriented
way with rules and stuff like

1314
00:05:56,707 --> 00:05:58,707
that.

1315
00:05:58,827 --> 00:06:02,531
And then, finally, in the
package. json, these are the

1316
00:06:02,531 --> 00:06:07,544
two build scripts. You notice
the TSX in front and the

1317
00:06:09,351 --> 00:06:11,351
config file is written in
typescript.

1318
00:06:12,653 --> 00:06:14,653
I won't go into TS config
because I frankly don't

1319
00:06:14,653 --> 00:06:16,653
understand it that way.

1320
00:06:17,652 --> 00:06:20,757
But typescript has support for
JSX, so we turn it on with the

1321
00:06:20,757 --> 00:06:22,757
misnamed value React JSX.

1322
00:06:23,872 --> 00:06:27,481
It doesn't actually have any
React.

1323
00:06:27,481 --> 00:06:30,988
And then, second, pointing it
at our package, the JSX async

1324
00:06:34,091 --> 00:06:36,091
runtime which then teaches the
compiler where everything is so

1325
00:06:36,091 --> 00:06:38,091
we don't have to manually
import.

1326
00:06:42,351 --> 00:06:45,863
Here is our 11ty config file.
11ty has support out of the box

1327
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:47,863
for JavaScript templates.

1328
00:06:49,177 --> 00:06:51,590
And what we want to do is say,
these file extensions are

1329
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:53,590
actually JavaScript.

1330
00:06:54,895 --> 00:06:56,895
Even though it says jsx,
THOECHB it says ts.

1331
00:06:59,899 --> 00:07:01,899
Because that tsx package is
going to transparentally

1332
00:07:01,899 --> 00:07:03,899
convert all of that into
JavaScript.

1333
00:07:08,221 --> 00:07:10,221
Finally, in the config, this
was the big breakthrough

1334
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:12,221
eleventy.

1335
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:16,332
config gives us a plug point to
do transforms, and in one

1336
00:07:16,332 --> 00:07:18,332
central location instead of
doing it throughout the code,

1337
00:07:18,332 --> 00:07:20,332
we were able to transform a jsx
node into a

1338
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,943
string asynchronously, and
then, just for fun, we

1339
00:07:25,943 --> 00:07:27,943
centralized the placement of

1340
00:07:29,046 --> 00:07:31,046
a dot.

1341
00:07:32,843 --> 00:07:37,448
One last step, we wanted to do
testing and so in vtest, it has

1342
00:07:37,448 --> 00:07:40,655
support for the fake browsers,
out of the box, it supports

1343
00:07:40,655 --> 00:07:42,655
happy dom, this was the line
that we put in to get our good

1344
00:07:42,655 --> 00:07:47,045
testing. I'll take a look over.
And see, no, not a lot

1345
00:07:47,641 --> 00:07:50,550
of dependencies. We removed
dependencies, in fact, as we

1346
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:52,550
went along.

1347
00:07:53,447 --> 00:07:55,447
OK. Over to some demos.

1348
00:07:58,043 --> 00:08:01,742
I'll go ahead and switch over
to...  the sample repository,

1349
00:08:01,742 --> 00:08:03,742
and then, I'll go back to our

1350
00:08:03,753 --> 00:08:07,339
repository to show some of this
in action.

1351
00:08:07,339 --> 00:08:09,339
I'm going to show you an
end-to-end of the smallest

1352
00:08:09,339 --> 00:08:11,339
possible thing without a lot of
extra concepts.

1353
00:08:13,841 --> 00:08:17,248
Here is the home page or my
site, and you see that it's got

1354
00:08:17,248 --> 00:08:20,343
layout, front matter,
everything we understand, but

1355
00:08:20,343 --> 00:08:22,343
because I've switched over to
this tooling

1356
00:08:23,437 --> 00:08:25,437
friendly approach, I don't have
to think too much about files

1357
00:08:27,649 --> 00:08:31,141
anymore, and I can think about
symbols.

1358
00:08:31,141 --> 00:08:33,141
And so every page on the site
has a main layout, and I can

1359
00:08:33,358 --> 00:08:36,463
navigate to this main layout.
This is what the file looks

1360
00:08:36,463 --> 00:08:38,463
like.

1361
00:08:39,757 --> 00:08:41,757
If you've done any of the ESM
stuff, this line will look

1362
00:08:41,757 --> 00:08:43,757
familiar to you.

1363
00:08:43,864 --> 00:08:45,864
You need to export a named
export called render.

1364
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:51,863
I rename everything so that I
can have similar bombsymbols so

1365
00:08:51,863 --> 00:08:53,863
everything isn't

1366
00:08:53,863 --> 00:08:57,409
named render. I've got a
function called main layout.

1367
00:08:57,409 --> 00:09:00,909
This might look a little
React-y to you. And what it's

1368
00:09:00,909 --> 00:09:02,909
doing is saying, hey, I'm going
to

1369
00:09:05,119 --> 00:09:07,119
be passed these two things, I
know what I'm going to get

1370
00:09:07,119 --> 00:09:09,119
passed,

1371
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,615
and any caller can get
auto-complete for this .

1372
00:09:11,615 --> 00:09:13,615
You can get auto-complete
because we

1373
00:09:15,227 --> 00:09:17,227
do props and prompts in a
typescript type.

1374
00:09:18,332 --> 00:09:21,633
And now, tooling can help me. I
can mouse over this and see

1375
00:09:21,633 --> 00:09:23,633
what is the

1376
00:09:23,633 --> 00:09:25,835
contract that needs to be
obeyed? And what I can

1377
00:09:25,835 --> 00:09:27,835
destructure from it?

1378
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:32,337
I can get auto-complete,
obviously.

1379
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:37,141
I can get a squiggle if I make
a mistake . I could even

1380
00:09:37,141 --> 00:09:39,141
decide, no, really, I want this
to be

1381
00:09:39,141 --> 00:09:41,850
called "heading. " And
everywhere in my project that

1382
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,850
uses that will

1383
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:46,951
now use heading, including

1384
00:09:48,358 --> 00:09:50,358
the prompts because there's
great tooling support for

1385
00:09:50,358 --> 00:09:52,358
typescript.
There's great tooling support

1386
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:55,966
for jsx, and if I don't like
that, I undo it. And everything

1387
00:09:55,966 --> 00:09:57,966
in the universe goes back to
what I had

1388
00:09:58,572 --> 00:10:01,873
before I did the refactoring.
Again, this is stuff that

1389
00:10:01,873 --> 00:10:03,873
people are familiar

1390
00:10:04,969 --> 00:10:06,969
with in the frontend

1391
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:10,066
world, and we're getting the
good parts of that while

1392
00:10:10,066 --> 00:10:12,676
leaving the whole agenda of
client-side rendering.

1393
00:10:15,876 --> 00:10:17,876
I'm returning jsx instead of a
template, I

1394
00:10:18,171 --> 00:10:21,471
get all of the stuff like
auto-complete in here. And

1395
00:10:21,471 --> 00:10:23,471
then, this is a fun one,

1396
00:10:24,882 --> 00:10:26,882
I'm showing -- writing my site
in

1397
00:10:27,982 --> 00:10:30,287
a reusable component-driven
fashion . So I do little units

1398
00:10:30,287 --> 00:10:32,287
of increment.

1399
00:10:33,596 --> 00:10:35,596
And I can get auto-complete of
my headings.

1400
00:10:40,802 --> 00:10:42,802
And when I do the
auto-complete, generates

1401
00:10:44,009 --> 00:10:46,009
the report for me, and I get
all of the things that you

1402
00:10:46,009 --> 00:10:48,009
would expect from good tooling.

1403
00:10:48,611 --> 00:10:51,813
I can then navigate to the
heading, see how it's

1404
00:10:51,813 --> 00:10:53,813
implemented, and then, I can do
the way I

1405
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:56,519
do development, which is in a
test.

1406
00:10:57,811 --> 00:11:00,910
And so, I'm working over here,
I've got my test over here .

1407
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,910
And if I

1408
00:11:04,115 --> 00:11:07,419
changed this word to "Zach "
and run this test, it's going

1409
00:11:10,925 --> 00:11:12,925
to fail, and I might be
confused why it failed

1410
00:11:14,036 --> 00:11:17,141
. Well, I can go into the
debugger, stop on this line,

1411
00:11:17,141 --> 00:11:19,141
that's the first time

1412
00:11:20,548 --> 00:11:22,548
through, and I see, oh, yeah,
duh, I passed in --

1413
00:11:23,752 --> 00:11:25,752
I didn't pass in tsx, I passed
in Zach, that's why I ran into

1414
00:11:25,752 --> 00:11:27,752
the problem.

1415
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:32,160
So that's a little bit of a run
through of the test-driven

1416
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,860
development approach on this.
I'll look over here. And see.

1417
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,860
Some comments.

1418
00:11:39,359 --> 00:11:41,359
Hey, Collin, thank you for
helping me out here.

1419
00:11:42,664 --> 00:11:46,977
I do like the minimum layout in
my IDE in here.

1420
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:52,176
And with all of that in mind,
here's the way I actually work.

1421
00:11:54,686 --> 00:11:56,808
I run vtest in watch mode.
Because it's so fast.

1422
00:11:59,815 --> 00:12:01,815
And I run it in watch mode
under the debugger.

1423
00:12:03,118 --> 00:12:06,723
And so, I've got my entire 11ty
development that is running at

1424
00:12:06,723 --> 00:12:08,723
all times

1425
00:12:08,723 --> 00:12:11,334
whenever I make a change. And
so, if I fix

1426
00:12:14,654 --> 00:12:17,158
this, that's my turn around
time. I didn't go to a browser

1427
00:12:17,158 --> 00:12:22,072
and hit reload. I didn't run an
11ty build.

1428
00:12:25,877 --> 00:12:27,877
In fact, if I wanted to, and
I'm like, I'm confused here, I

1429
00:12:27,877 --> 00:12:31,892
don't have a bug, I just don't
know what's going on here. Set

1430
00:12:31,892 --> 00:12:33,892
a break point, press space, and
you will stop there.

1431
00:12:35,496 --> 00:12:37,496
And sometimes, 11ty hands me a
lot of

1432
00:12:38,601 --> 00:12:41,704
data, a lot of surface area in
page, a lot of surface area in

1433
00:12:41,704 --> 00:12:43,704
data, and I get confused, I'm a
man of a certain age.

1434
00:12:44,113 --> 00:12:47,612
I just want to see what's
available. And this is what I

1435
00:12:47,612 --> 00:12:51,022
do to stop at a certain point
in rendering and see what is

1436
00:12:51,022 --> 00:12:53,022
available to me at that point.

1437
00:12:53,026 --> 00:12:55,232
All right. I will continue.

1438
00:13:00,638 --> 00:13:02,638
Obviously, we want to see does
this

1439
00:13:03,847 --> 00:13:05,847
thing actually render a
template that can be used in a

1440
00:13:05,847 --> 00:13:07,847
browser?

1441
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:12,055
So after I've done all of my
development, that's when I

1442
00:13:12,055 --> 00:13:14,055
actually

1443
00:13:14,055 --> 00:13:16,662
go over to a browser and look
at it . And, yes, actually,

1444
00:13:18,863 --> 00:13:22,155
it is a very nice size. It did
render, it could use a little

1445
00:13:22,155 --> 00:13:26,646
bit of help from Miriam on the
styling, obviously.

1446
00:13:26,646 --> 00:13:28,646
That's an end-to-end

1447
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:31,742
tour of the minima with about 5
minutes

1448
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:34,950
left, I'll take a look at what
we're doing in our knowledge

1449
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,950
base . Feel free to ask any
questions, Collin is show

1450
00:13:39,156 --> 00:13:41,156
runner with me on that project,
and he can answer anything over

1451
00:13:41,156 --> 00:13:43,156
there.

1452
00:13:43,951 --> 00:13:47,048
I'm going to switch over to our
actual project . This is our

1453
00:13:47,048 --> 00:13:49,048
knowledge base.

1454
00:13:49,749 --> 00:13:51,749
It's pretty big.

1455
00:13:53,044 --> 00:13:55,228
So this is all the content, or
all the programming languages

1456
00:13:55,228 --> 00:13:57,228
that JetBrain supports.

1457
00:14:01,728 --> 00:14:03,728
These are all of the components
that we have that are isolate

1458
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:07,135
d and easy to test and stuff
like that we can use wherever.

1459
00:14:10,023 --> 00:14:12,023
And so, this is, again, test
driven development

1460
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,120
. What I'm going to do this
time is I'm going to run all of

1461
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,120
the tests in the entire site
under the debugger.

1462
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,620
Vtest will fire it up the first
time, it'll take a few seconds

1463
00:14:23,714 --> 00:14:25,714
to fire up the first time vtest
has gotten faster. I could

1464
00:14:25,714 --> 00:14:27,714
speed this up.

1465
00:14:28,616 --> 00:14:30,616
Once it's running, all of my
tests pass, I have 131 tests.

1466
00:14:32,925 --> 00:14:35,723
And I make a mistake. Here is a
usage of a test. I'm calling

1467
00:14:35,723 --> 00:14:37,723
the heading.

1468
00:14:38,403 --> 00:14:40,403
Passing in the two values. I
make a mistake.

1469
00:14:42,998 --> 00:14:45,090
And then, my test no longer
passes, I get a little squiggle

1470
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:47,090
here.

1471
00:14:48,381 --> 00:14:50,381
I can mouse over it and get
more information for exactly

1472
00:14:50,381 --> 00:14:52,381
what the problem is.

1473
00:14:53,467 --> 00:14:55,467
But that's a pretty fast turn
around time under the debugger

1474
00:14:55,467 --> 00:14:57,467
for working with your site.

1475
00:14:58,572 --> 00:15:00,572
And we never went to the
browser, and we never did

1476
00:15:00,572 --> 00:15:02,572
console log.

1477
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,166
The part that I wanted to
finish with is the other stuff

1478
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:10,064
besides just developer
experience. We also added some

1479
00:15:10,064 --> 00:15:12,064
stuff from an authoring
experience.

1480
00:15:13,965 --> 00:15:16,775
So if you were interested in
leaving Gatsby, these are some

1481
00:15:16,775 --> 00:15:18,775
of the kinds of things you
might also be interested in.

1482
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,174
For example, I'm sitting in a
markdown file.

1483
00:15:28,465 --> 00:15:30,465
This is actually the tutorial
that we wrote for this

1484
00:15:30,465 --> 00:15:32,465
conference . And I have front
matter up here.

1485
00:15:36,577 --> 00:15:38,577
Well, my front matter actually
has a schema.

1486
00:15:39,868 --> 00:15:41,868
And so, if I were to write
author, I get auto-complete.

1487
00:15:45,966 --> 00:15:47,966
But I don't get autocomplete
just of the keys, I

1488
00:15:49,773 --> 00:15:51,773
get auto-complete of the
values, that is actually

1489
00:15:53,384 --> 00:15:57,385
i... y...

1490
00:15:58,785 --> 00:16:02,384
markdown file. PWE was the
thing, it's in content

1491
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:07,490
space, it's not in software
space.

1492
00:16:07,997 --> 00:16:11,695
How are we doing that?
We have a bunch of resources

1493
00:16:15,003 --> 00:16:17,110
that we define in typescript,
and let me go to tip model.

1494
00:16:18,503 --> 00:16:22,394
Tip models, yeah. We define our
schemas in typescript.

1495
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:26,390
Here's the schema for a tip.

1496
00:16:27,684 --> 00:16:29,684
And then, we use type box to
convert that to a JSON schema

1497
00:16:29,684 --> 00:16:31,684
we can enforce.

1498
00:16:34,242 --> 00:16:37,437
And then, every single time you
hit save, we rerun some

1499
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:42,433
code that writes a JSON schema.

1500
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:45,633
We dump all of the schemas to
disk. And here's what the

1501
00:16:45,633 --> 00:16:47,633
schema looks like.

1502
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:52,130
And so the IDE sees this, it
sees that

1503
00:16:53,337 --> 00:16:55,337
these are all of the possible
values, and we give an

1504
00:16:55,337 --> 00:16:57,337
authoring experience where an
author.

1505
00:16:58,242 --> 00:17:01,538
This was the thinking that
killed us in Gatsby. You would

1506
00:17:01,538 --> 00:17:03,538
put in a wrong value, and you

1507
00:17:03,538 --> 00:17:05,538
would fail.

1508
00:17:07,636 --> 00:17:09,636
And you would fail obscurely,
and you would have no hope

1509
00:17:09,636 --> 00:17:11,636
other than coming to me and
getting me to look at your

1510
00:17:11,636 --> 00:17:13,636
branch.

1511
00:17:13,636 --> 00:17:16,023
We really wanted with the
embrace of 11ty, we really

1512
00:17:16,023 --> 00:17:18,023
wanted to give a better
authoring experience on this.

1513
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:22,519
Some other things we would like
to talk about at a later

1514
00:17:23,624 --> 00:17:26,125
date, things such as the
content model that has plugable

1515
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:28,125
resource types and the queries.

1516
00:17:28,226 --> 00:17:31,519
Zach is adding in 3. 0, more
hook points that are exactly

1517
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:33,519
the hook points

1518
00:17:34,927 --> 00:17:36,927
we need for validation, for
custom collections , and things

1519
00:17:36,927 --> 00:17:38,927
like that.

1520
00:17:40,513 --> 00:17:42,513
And then, we also were
confronted with something for

1521
00:17:42,513 --> 00:17:44,513
client side rendering where we
wanted to keep the templating

1522
00:17:44,513 --> 00:17:46,521
that we had and had to do a
work around for that.

1523
00:17:49,717 --> 00:17:51,717
With that in mind, this has
been a wonderful experience for

1524
00:17:51,717 --> 00:17:53,717
us.

1525
00:17:53,717 --> 00:17:56,519
Any of you that are interested
in moving from a larger system

1526
00:17:56,519 --> 00:17:58,519
with all of this tooling, such
as Gatsby,

1527
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:02,523
over to 11ty, please reach out,
let's see what we can do

1528
00:18:02,523 --> 00:18:07,523
working all of this stuff
together.

1529
00:18:07,523 --> 00:18:11,015
.
≫ MIKE: Thank you so much,

1530
00:18:11,015 --> 00:18:13,015
Paul, it's always interesting
seeing, like,

1531
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:17,110
how these big use are cases --
how 11ty

1532
00:18:19,179 --> 00:18:21,179
can and does a very good job of
it, of adapting to handle

1533
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:23,179
something like that.

1534
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:26,170
It was really interesting
seeing that workflow.

1535
00:18:29,768 --> 00:18:31,768
Which like a site, the scale of
your knowledge base,

1536
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:35,080
it makes a lot of sense that
you need all of that tooling.

1537
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,080
What was the buildout time?

1538
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:40,576
And how long did it take you to
transition from Gatsby to the

1539
00:18:40,576 --> 00:18:42,576
11ty setup?

1540
00:18:45,172 --> 00:18:47,382
≫ PAUL: Collin and I did a
first shot in 11ty 2 and got it

1541
00:18:47,382 --> 00:18:50,880
out the door. And then in the
second shot, we did a lot of

1542
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,880
just

1543
00:18:54,085 --> 00:18:56,085
redesign the user design and
user experience and stuff.

1544
00:18:58,273 --> 00:19:01,582
And along the way, as we really
got into what 11ty

1545
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,380
could do for us, it changed the
idea of the knowledge base

1546
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:08,380
completely.

1547
00:19:10,081 --> 00:19:12,081
You know, we'll let authors
create their own channels, and

1548
00:19:13,177 --> 00:19:15,177
they can write templates
because this is simple enough

1549
00:19:15,177 --> 00:19:17,177
that it can be put in the hands
of mere

1550
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,375
mortals.
≫ MIKE: That's awesome.

1551
00:19:23,056 --> 00:19:25,847
So the workflow and GitHub
pulling in those --

1552
00:19:25,847 --> 00:19:27,847
≫ PAUL: Indeed.
≫ MIKE: That's awesome.

1553
00:19:30,942 --> 00:19:32,942
≫ PAUL: Just -- to reinforce
the point you're

1554
00:19:34,032 --> 00:19:36,032
making, people might have this
idea that 11ty is for personal

1555
00:19:36,032 --> 00:19:38,032
blogs. Let's change that.

1556
00:19:40,524 --> 00:19:42,524
Let's tell people that you can
do big projects,

1557
00:19:43,619 --> 00:19:47,202
Zach continues to add what's
needed for that. And let's see

1558
00:19:47,202 --> 00:19:50,308
how far we can go before 11ty
runs out of steam.

1559
00:19:52,904 --> 00:19:54,904
≫ MIKE: Yeah, it's actually
ideal for doing something like

1560
00:19:54,904 --> 00:19:56,904
that. Like, what other kind of
benefits have you

1561
00:19:59,613 --> 00:20:02,112
seen from move inging from
Gatsby to 11ty? I imagine your

1562
00:20:02,112 --> 00:20:04,112
build time came down?

1563
00:20:04,614 --> 00:20:06,614
Yeah, did it come down?

1564
00:20:12,831 --> 00:20:16,134
≫ PAUL: It came down from
infinity. What happened was,

1565
00:20:16,134 --> 00:20:18,134
you couldn't trust the Gatsby
cache,

1566
00:20:19,338 --> 00:20:21,338
so you had to do a full build
all the time and in our CI, it

1567
00:20:21,338 --> 00:20:23,338
would never complete before the
CI canceled the job.

1568
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:26,654
≫ MIKE: OK. That's a lot less.

1569
00:20:28,258 --> 00:20:30,357
[ Laughter ]
So you'd have to build locally

1570
00:20:30,357 --> 00:20:32,444
and push it up?
≫ PAUL: Yeah, right.

1571
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:37,032
≫ MIKE: Wow. Incredible. Yeah,
that's a big win.

1572
00:20:39,024 --> 00:20:42,039
CI being able to build your
site.

1573
00:20:45,231 --> 00:20:47,231
≫ PAUL: Indeed, and from an
authoring experience

1574
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:49,231
perspective, I know we're going
to be thinking -- actually, the

1575
00:20:49,231 --> 00:20:51,441
talks at this conference are
very author-focused. And that's

1576
00:20:51,441 --> 00:20:53,441
great.

1577
00:20:53,441 --> 00:20:55,441
It's not just machinery.

1578
00:20:59,733 --> 00:21:01,733
When you can build sites that
give you the feedback that

1579
00:21:01,733 --> 00:21:03,733
instantaneously

1580
00:21:03,733 --> 00:21:06,229
and provide the hook points for
people like me that are

1581
00:21:06,229 --> 00:21:08,229
interested in content
management systems, you can

1582
00:21:08,229 --> 00:21:12,332
have an authoring experience
that is really fantastic.

1583
00:21:12,332 --> 00:21:15,327
There's nothing worse than an
author that feels dumb, right?

1584
00:21:15,327 --> 00:21:17,327
≫ MIKE: Yeah.

1585
00:21:19,222 --> 00:21:21,222
And ultimately, like, most
websites are managed by

1586
00:21:21,222 --> 00:21:23,222
nontechnical people.

1587
00:21:24,331 --> 00:21:26,331
It's so important to think
about the workflows and empower

1588
00:21:26,331 --> 00:21:28,331
editors .

1589
00:21:28,331 --> 00:21:30,638
≫ PAUL: They're not developers,
they're humans.

1590
00:21:30,638 --> 00:21:32,638
≫ MIKE: Thanks, again, for
joining today, Paul. Fantastic.

1591
00:21:32,638 --> 00:21:34,638
≫ PAUL: Thanks for having me.
≫ MIKE: All right.
